  "description" : "The source connector consumes posts and comments from Reddit in real time. It's\npossible to read comments from one collection of subreddits and posts from a different\ncollection, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/all/\">r/all</a> can be read from for\neither.\n\nSeparate topics are used for posts and comments; they default to reddit-posts and\nreddit-comments respectively but can be configured differently if necessary.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mattbdean/jraw\">JRAW</a> is used to continuously stream new\nposts and comments; many thanks go to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mattbdean\">Matt Dean</a> for creating that excellent\nlibrary.\n\nThis connector is currently intended for development and entertainment purposes only and\nis not recommended or endorsed for production use cases.",
