So earning a salary between 50k-1.5L a month makes you ""lowest strata of the middle class""?? How does that make any sense? One can live very well on such a salary, affording lots of domestic help and travel as well as good purchasing power. How can the finance minister make such statements? Isn't she supposed to know better? Or is that by and large no longer a requirement for people holding powerful offices worldwide?

My name is Mike Broihier, and I am running for US Senate here in Kentucky as a Democrat, to retire Mitch McConnell and restore our republic. [Proof](https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1263539478985158659)

I’ve been a Marine, a farmer, a public school teacher, a college professor, a county government official, and spent five years as a reporter and then editor of a local newspaper.

As a Marine Corps officer, I led marines and sailors in wartime and peace for over 20 years. I aided humanitarian efforts during the Somali Civil War, and I worked with our allies to shape defense plans for the Republic of Korea. My wife Lynn is also a Marine. We retired from the Marine Corps in 2005 and bought Chicken Bristle Farm, a 75-acre farm plot in Lincoln County.

Together we've raised livestock and developed the largest all-natural and sustainable asparagus operation in central Kentucky. I worked as a substitute teacher in the local school district and as a reporter and editor for the Interior Journal, the third oldest newspaper in our Commonwealth.

I have a deep appreciation, understanding, and respect for the struggles that working families and rural communities endure every day in Kentucky – the kind that only comes from living it. That's why I am running a progressive campaign here in Kentucky that focuses on economic and social justice, with a Universal Basic Income as one of my central policy proposals.

[And we have just been endorsed by Andrew Yang!](https://twitter.com/MikeForKY/status/1263825019530096641)

Nobody gives a fuck about sex education. Many of us don't know that you have to clean under the foreskin of your penis. Otherwise Smegma will build up under the foreskin also known as ""Dick cheese"" Left untreated, smegma can cause an odor or in some cases, harden and lead to irritation in the genitals and thats why you see some guys hand always in thier pants (it can also be due to other reason like insect bite, dryskin or healing wounds they feel itching). And yes you can and should pull the foreskin all the way back to make sex and masturbation more enjoyable and if you are not able to do that don't worry its normal and there are many excercise's to make foreskin more stretchy.


How to clean the smegma or how to clean under the foreskin? 

Properly cleaning your penis is the easiest way to remove smegma

1. Gently pull back your foreskin. If the smegma has hardened, you may not be able to pull it back all the way. Don’t force it, as that can cause pain and tear the skin, which could lead to infection.

2. Use a mild soap and warm water to wash the area that’s usually covered by your foreskin. Avoid harsh scrubbing, as that can irritate the sensitive skin. If the smegma has hardened, gently rubbing oil on the area before cleaning it may help loosen up the accumulation.

3. Thoroughly rinse off all the soap and then gently pat the area dry.

4. Pull your foreskin back over the tip of your penis.

5. Repeat this daily until the smegma disappears.

*Edit* If your looking for the stretching excercises :

Then a month or two later, you will be offered your earlier job on contractual rates, part time, and at a far reduced take home for the same amount of work. So now you arent unemplyed, just making less money. Where does the surplus go? The Ambanis take it. 

So, it's laughable when these jokers do a drama of sacrifice etc. They know they are making money down the line. "

""While Indians might have harboured confusion about their relationship with China, China has been clear about their POV. 

They consider India an adversary to be weakened, broken and subjugated in every way.  And they have been at it for years now. Let military men talk about military things. As a businessman, let me talk about business. 

Let me tell you 2 anecdotes about China. 

CASE 1 

Back in 2008/09, I had to procure a particularly large quantity of flooring from China for a hotel project. Indian manufacturers had scant range, Europeans were far too expensive. It made sense to explore China. 

So I spent considerable time exploring the best that China had to offer. The best of what I liked fell in the vitrified range, which had very attractive pricing but attracted an Anti Dumping Duty in India. The option was to settle for Ceramic, which was at best a compromise. Since the order was pretty large and I seemed keen on the vitrified, the vendor’s Sales Head, one of the largest manufacturers in China, invited me over for dinner. Over the course of the evening, he delicately broached the topic.

Why don't you buy the vitrified tiles, since they serve your purpose? he asked. 
Anti Dumping Duty makes it unviable to import, I replied.
Let me propose a solution, he said. You import the vitrified tiles and we will pay the Anti Dumping Duty.
Why would you do that? I asked.
There's a catch. We’ll pay the Anti Dumping Duty on the condition that you go back and file a case in your courts to remove Anti Dumping Duty from Chinese vitrified tiles. Hire the best lawyers, pursue the case. We will pay all your legal charges too. 

I began getting the drift of the conversation. 

Let me think about it, I said and backed out. 

We didn't buy, but I was interested enough to research that company. Turned out, it was registered in the British Virgin Islands, behind a web of screens, probably owned by senior Communist Party officials.

CASE 2

A very large ophthalmic lens company wanted me to help them procure lenses from China. Again, around 2006-07.
So we explored and narrowed down to a mom-pop Chinese manufacturer, in the suburbs of Shanghai, with a capacity to manufacture almost 60% of India’s demand.

The importer’s Manager who had come along with me, a particularly hardnosed Sindhi gentleman, was obscenely negotiative. The mom-pop factory had their daughter study international business to be able to deal in English with foreign buyers. She led the negotiations. The haggling came to the point that the daughter called the cost ledger to show us that our expected price was just about covering their manufacturing cost. 

Our Sindhi friend wasn't taking no for an answer, Why the hell are we in China, if not to buy cheap? He argued.

After 3 hrs, we had a deal. At 1% above cost! 

To celebrate they took us out for dinner. There, I asked the daughter, how can you manage to deliver at 1% over cost?
She gave all sorts of candy floss answers till I broke her defences.

You see, she said, we will get 10% export subsidy. We will get it by the end of the year but that will take care of the profits. Till then, the cost +1% will bring in the cash flows.

That's how China has structured their game. Make the world dependent on China. Offer deals that a buyer just can't refuse.

When we flood the SM with Boycott Chinese Products, it hits them where it hurts.
Decades of planning comes tumbling down.
Know your adversaries. Make up your mind on Chiese products.

They are making you pay for your own surrender.

Boycotting products hurts them personally. Most businesses are owned by CP officials. Boycotting causes personal losses to them.

India China standoff may have military overtones. What hurts is the boycott of Chinese products & weaning of International manufacturers from China.""

My note: It'd be interesting to dig up the names of ALL Indian entities who have filed suits against Anti-Dumping Duties. We will get our list of sell coats.

I sent my invoice for Rs 21,600 for the said project on March 8th, 2020, when there was no pandemic and no lockdown, due to be cleared by the end of the month. 

After delaying the payment for more than a month citing COVID,  they asked me to work on one more project on April 23rd, this time for an agreed amount of Rs. 7000. Having worked with them before for 2 years and being in desperate need of money, I agreed to the project. (Big mistake) 

I received a payment of Rs. 10,000 on April 24th for the first project and was assured of the remaining payment by the end of April.

Times are hard for all of us, and I've tried my best to be patient and understanding but my biggest contention in this situation is that despite knowing they might be unable to clear my dues for the first project, they brought me on for another assignment.

I don't have much idea about loans but I hope you have considered the current situation if you're planning to start your masters in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021. It will take a long time to come out of recession for all countries (Germany has already entered the recession) and it may have adverse effects on your internship, part-time job and job searching. Don't know specifics about Germany but in US, nearly 40 million people have filed for unemployment in last 9 weeks. And if you cannot find a part-time job in Germany then living and food expenses too can add up. (I am guessing 20L is for university fees only, right?) As of now many companies have froze hiring and even cancelled the job offers so those will be again in the market for job hunting in future. Not want to discourage you but given your financial situation, this might be a big risk and can bring more pressure and depression. So my suggestion would be to keep working/find a job in India, build a good profile and consider masters after 1-1.5 years.

Airtel  had closed my case without providing a resolution. I tweeted them  the  screenshot of that closure message and my cardinal sin was that I   overlooked the fact that, that message contained my phone number.

Immediately  I got a call from 9330284713 claiming to be from airtel. He  gave me  another number 9223011112 and claimed that it is a number  associated  with my Airtel Customer ID.He forwarded me a code saying that it is airtel settings and asked me forward it to that second number.

Since it did look like a usual airtel message, I forwarded that code.

He  then asked me to download ""TeamViewer"" app. This sent emergency  lights  and sirens blaring throughout my head because TeamViewer is an  app  that provides remote access to a destination system. I screwed him,   threatened him with action and he disconnected the call.

But  the damage was done. He had withdrawn 5k. The code that he had sent was  apparently a UPI pin. It looked like this: abupi  XXXXXXXX@XXXXXXXX\*XXXXXXXXXX

I  started getting messages from Andhra Bank saying that my salary  account  was now tagged to their UPI. I immediately called Andhra Bank  and they  recognized the fraud. They suggested that I call my salary bank  acc  and report it asap.

I called my Salary acc bank and they instantly deactivated my cards, online banking and UPI ID thereby limiting the damage.

I  have been receiving OTPs from 100s of websites from an hour. I can't   even imagine what would be the situation if I had downloaded Teamviewer.   He has opened my account in Yes Bank now.

I have lodged a cyber complaint on [cybercrime.gov.in](https://cybercrime.gov.in/)

I  am also getting messages from multiple banks like this: ""Dear User, You  have initiated the process of adding your YES BANK account in your UPI  App. Report it to us in case it is not you. Never share card  details/OTP.""

Please advise what I  should do. How can I unlink my mob number from all these places. Now  that he has that UPI pin thing, would he cause any further damage after I  get my account reactivated?

Edit 1: Spoke to Airtel about my number being added to every bank. They asked me to deactivate my number and get a new sim. I asked how that would make a difference since the number would be the same. They said that wouldn't be the case since all the settings associated with the number would be reset. What do you guys think about this?

IMPORTANT EDIT: The reason why I am saying that the code he sent looked like usual Airtel settings message is BECAUSE back in April, I was working with Airtel on another issue of theirs. Even that was going on on Twitter. On the day I first tweeted them, I got a similar message: ""AIRUPI xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"". During then, I had not posted my number anywhere else other than on Airtel's message inbox because they specifically ask you to DM your number to speak to you. Do you think there could be something fishy related to Airtel?

Most Important Edit: using that UPI PIN and my phone number, would he be able to clone my sim? Asking because I had posted this same post on Facebook. It has gotten deleted just a few minutes back.",1590967138.0,[removed]

Assuming non involvement of foreign colonial powers, there were mainly two nations that were very keen on conquering Mughal territory and asserting influence: **Sikhs** and **Marathas**.

Since, both were ambitious, war hardened and wary of each other - civil war was the only possible outcome.

Here goes.

I don’t know if any of you have watched all of the steams I posted, but that was a moment for a group of people whose words were easy to find; words that were born out of a spectrum of emotions that only we understand collectively. These feelings are raw and unforgiving right now and we can only hope that our toes remain on the gas pedal this time. Up until this moment in my life, the greatest collective energy I have felt by a singular group of people was in the pit at the Saint Pablo Tour almost three years ago. The energy of the march today made that moment feel like a sardine caught in a tsunami, because I myself felt like a sardine in a tsunami today. The looks on peoples’ faces were all the same: masked and protected by hats and sunglasses… but I’m sure if the presence of COVID-19 wasn’t our reality right now, the sentiment would have been this: pissed off. Pissed off that these deaths and murders keep happening, pissed off that our city is bruised, pissed off that they do not feel represented by our elected officials, and pissed off that nobody is listening.

I’m pretty pissed off too. Have been for a while actually. Today I decided to walk the walk because I'm tired of talking the talk.

I didn’t get a good head count, but I would guess I joined somewhere between 400-500 Americans in our march through Downtown Dallas today. We chanted, we documented and for those who couldn’t attend, some of us provided you with our direct vantage point through the misunderstood miracle of Facebook Live. We stood and marched together. We found and were able to return somebody’s car keys. We gave each other water when we were thirsty. There was a guy walking around with loaves of bread, pulling peanut butter and jelly from his backpack making sandwiches on the fly for anyone that wanted one, the line was kinda long and he didn’t miss a beat! Every time the passerby's laid on their horns, threw their fists out of their car windows, I got chills. We also stopped at major intersections to bring awareness to the murder of George Floyd. We sat silently for eight minutes and 46 seconds, got back up and started the march again. I being the mutineer of normality that I am, opted to kneel in my Nikes with my head down and my fist up, because I’ve drawn most of my inspiration from this movement from Colin Kaepernick and his unwavering heroism.

The demographics were mixed to say the least; skin, hair and eyes of every color, all fairly represented. For the sake of transparency, the largest ethnic group that were attendance were black, but not by much of a margin, the vast minority in the group were whites, followed by Hispanic, Asian and then Middle Eastern. Generation Z had the highest turnout at about 70%, followed by 20-25% Millennials and a smattering of Gen-X and Boomers to fill the void.

At the end of our march at City Hall, I was approached by a lady with a microphone and a gentleman with a camera, asking my thoughts on the march. I told them that me and my white skin are not the ones you need to be asking those questions to and that I did not come here to speak, I came here to shut up, listen and learn.

These kids today aren’t like us. We may have saw the towers fall, but nothing comes close to seeing members of your family and community regularly murdered by police, fellow students and total strangers. They have the grit to keep the wave going, they just need to be steered in the right direction and it’s going to take education, patience and understanding because they are a damn stubborn bunch dealing with so many broken hearts at such an early age. We must continue the conversations, and if you haven’t started yet, we need to listen.

Listen to the kids bro.",1591231606.0,[deleted]

Word quickly makes its way across the stadium. I thought UB going to the locker room with the lead at the half silenced 100,000 people. Turns out having a punter's leg snapped in half *really* silences 100,000 people. You could hear a pin drop in a stadium that is normally one of the loudest in all of football.

174,"Finance Basics – Share Market,Mutual fund, Insurance",81,fxb9zh,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fxb9zh/finance_basics_share_marketmutual_fund_insurance/,False,36,Business/Finance,"Lets learn something being at home. Any doubts you can message me.

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is – why we need to invest. It’s because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That’s called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1. Share Market –
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India’s largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that’s called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their coin.zerodha.com to trade mutual funds. It’s free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It’s easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3. Insurance :
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party – first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that…

But only death benefit, else you won’t get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . Health insurance is a must though.",1586397416.0,Thank you so much!

186,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ₹17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why",387,fv9ifd,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fv9ifd/delhi_has_not_been_given_a_single_paisa_from_the/,False,57,Policy/Economy,"Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ₹17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ₹17,000 crore, ₹11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫

Similarly, the approximately ₹6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union’s devolution under the XV-FC’s recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I’ve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi’s SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",1586098195.0,Do we know how much of that money did they allocate to each state?

Since the 1950's india spent 3% of its GDP on infrastructure while the Chinese spent 9% of its GDP other than this what else sharp contrast can we see

Do you guys think that communism would have worked better in india due to us lacking the intellectual capacity to decide what's best for ourselves and the country ???

Do you guys also think that nehru was a leader who lacked the wider understanding of the indian subcontinent compared to Mustafa kemal in Turkey who had a perfect economic and political vision for turkey compared to nehru who just wanted peace and diversity ???",1591898726.0,"No. It was communism in a way that spread this virus in the first place. The problem in Indian politics is that we have this weird love affair where we like to be communist when it helps us and democratic when it helps us. You can't have both ways. Having babu Raj is what plagued us in the past and it still goes on to plague us. In a way we need more open markets and governments carinig about governence. 

Socialism is great but you need a shit ton of money to do so and you need high taxes but I believe no one likes that. We lakh intellectual property but you are definitely allowed to use patents for humanitarian reasons. Do you really want to cause more political turmoil over something you can get free ?

GDP margins are easy to quote but I assume you are a economic enthusiast. Please do look at other matrices like NDP NNP and HDI. I can spend hundred percent of my GDP on infrastructure but are people using it or do they have a reason to use it ? While building structures am I destroying existing property to do so or massively affecting the local populations ? Am I building projects that are actually useful or are actually just white elephant projects ?

A lot goes into the planing of massive undertakings. At the end of a government is for the people it should have had a high HDI. Per capita income is tricky because you have to look into the purchasing power parity. But regardless, if historically a communist country was able to get a massively good HDI internationally it would all be great but as of now no form of communism has done so. Russia economy after the cold war was less than that of New York. We all know how amazing life is in North Korea and the CCP has way too many skeletons in the closet to make sure that their people are actually happy.

Many a times a ton of politically driven youth think that a broken system has to be discarded and we need to spend time and effort on our owns systems. Most times it just some gears that need changing. Please remove out your populist view cap over communism and think about it in as an economic thinker. Look definitely people will like it because everyone thinks they are the 99% but in most cases you are the 1% whose possessions will be distributed. And who will define the 1%, the government ? It will then come to a time where you are the 1% because you have a bowl to eat from when your fellow man uses his hands to eat. It never stops. 

Every problem doesn't require a revolution. "

Then jio came along and revolutionised cellular data industry in india.

I know  you can just get wifi but not all indian dads allow it so it was a lifesaver for me and i could finally consume media with ease.

I have not seen any other company bringing out awesome deals during pandemic then jio.

It just launched new booster packs which are 30gb for 151 rupees,40gb for 201 rupees and 50gb for 251 rupees.

I can't thank them enough, other companies offer like 6gb for 100(talking about addon packs)

I can finally consume 1080p media and download games without wasting too much money(ive spent uncountable amounts of  cash on booster pakcs lol)

So basically in 5 years we have come from 1GB for 251 rupees to 50GB for 251 rupees haha lol ;)

https://preview.redd.it/dilg3h4e4cy41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=960e3fc9cd0281aeb23986fff935064449dbe7c1

### Tl;dr

Today, the Kerala High Court heard two petitions challenging mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu app. The app was made mandatory for all public and private sector employees by the Ministry of Home Affairs through guidelines issued to States/Union Territories under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. IFF provided legal assistance for the petition filed by Jackson Mathew, Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which was accompanied by an expert affidavit by Professor Subhashis Banerjee from IIT Delhi. During the hearings, the Kerala High Court directed the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to file a reply and to state on record that data collected by the app will not be misused. The petitions are listed next on 18 May.

### Download Aarogya Setu or Face Jail Time

On 1 May 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued guidelines making use of the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for all persons in containment zones and all public and private sector employees. In case of the latter, the head of the organization has been made responsible for ensuring 100% coverage of the app among employees. These directions were issued by MHA under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 (DMA) and any violation is liable to be punished under Section 51, DMA (up to 2 years imprisionment) and Section 188, IPC (up to 6 months imprisonment).

Since its launch, the Aarogya Setu app has been mired in controversy about its privacy and security practices, and we have analysed it in our [**working paper**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) which provides privacy prescriptions for COVID-19 tech interventions. After the Aarogya Setu app was made mandatory for vast sections of society by MHA on 1 May 2020, John Daniel, the General Secretary of Congress Thissur District Committee filed a PIL before the Kerala High Court challenging the constitutionality of these directions. Yesterday, another writ petition was filed by Jackson Mathew, the Managing Partner of Leetha Industries which employs 50 people against Aarogya Setu being made compulsory through the threat of criminal sanction. The petition filed by Jackson Mathew is accompanied by an expert affidavit by Dr. Subhashis Banerjee, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi which highlights utility and privacy concerns with the Aarogya Setu app. IFF retained counsels provided assistance for this petition.

After the petition was filed by Jackson Mathew yesterday morning, the government has released a  [**data access and knowledge sharing protocol**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Aarogya_Setu_data_access_knowledge_Protocol.pdf) for the app. We will shortly be posting an analysis of the protocol and its failure to address concerns about legality, purpose limitation, data minimization, transparency and accountability.

### Contagion of Technosolutionism

Despite serious concerns about the accuracy of COVID-19 surveillance apps, governments across the world have tried to leverage these apps to contain the spread of the virus. As Susan Landau [**notes**](https://www.lawfareblog.com/location-surveillance-counter-covid-19-efficacy-what-matters), when you have a hammer, it is tempting to see nails everywhere but India doesn't even have the level of smartphone and internet penetration required for such apps to even be theoretically effective. In a country where only 25% of the population has access to bluetooth enabled smartphones, the government has made the Aarogya Setu app mandatory for accessing essential services like [**railways**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aarogya-setu-app-mandatory-for-travel-on-15-special-trains-railways/article31563211.ece) and this will have a devastating exclusionary impact. 

In addition to this, bluetooth and GPS signals are not an accurate estimate of whether someone has been in close proximity (6 feet or less) with a COVID-19 infected person. This can lead to a high number of false positives and false negatives which end up causing more harm than good. For instance, bluetooth signals cannot recognize physical barriers such as walls and floors which make virus transmission impossible, and therefore, they may misidentify individuals as COVID-19 positive and send the authorities on a wild goose chase. Similarly, since bluetooth based apps cannot account for surface to person transmission, they will also yield false negatives. 

### ""Privacy by Design"" Not

Despite the government repeatedly claiming that the Aarogya Setu app does not raise any privacy or security concerns, the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy of the app tell a very different story. The writ petition filed by Jackson Mathew analyses these issues in great detail but in brief, the Aarogya Setu app violates the following data protection principles:

1. **Legality**  
The Aarogya Setu app which collects sensitive health and location data of millions of Indians has been launched without any governing legislative framework. The Disaster Management Act does not provide legislative basis for deployment of the Aarogya Setu app because it does not include any provisions for collection and processing of personal data. Retired Justice BN Srikrishna who headed the Committee on Data Protection has also [**explained**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/aarogya-setu-app-mandate-illegal-justice-b-n-srikrishna-6405535/) that making Aarogya Setu mandatory without an enabling legislation is completely illegal. He also pointed out that the protocol issued by the government cannot substitute legislation by the parliament.
2. **Consent**  
Based on [**MIT Tech Review’s Tracker**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/07/1000961/launching-mittr-covid-tracing-tracker/), India is the only democratic country which has made use of COVID-19 surveillance apps mandatory. Other countries which have made such apps mandatory are China and Turkey. However, in Turkey, only confirmed COVID-19 patients have to mandatorily download the app.
3. **Purpose Limitation and Data Sharing:**  
Clause 2(a) of the Privacy Policy states personal data collected at the time of registration can be used for *“medical* *and administrative interventions necessary”* in relation to COVID-19. This suggets that data collected by the app can be used for lockdown/quarantine enforcement. This is inconsistent with global best practices. For instance, the European Commission has clearly stated that data collected by COVID-19 surveillance apps should not be used for law enforcement or commercial purposes. 
4. **Data Minimization**  
Aarogya Setu collects location data through GPS and it can be used to track real time movements of individuals. This violates the principle of data minimization because location data is not necessary to determine if a user was in proximity of a COVID-19 positive person and bluetooth signals are sufficient for this purpose. 
5. **Security**  
The Aarogya Setu app anonymizes data by assigning each user a static device identifier. This kind of weak anonymization has been highlighted as a significant privacy concern by Professor Subhashis Banerjee in his expert affidavit. He notes that unlike other apps which issue new tokens to be used as a fresh ID after pre-specified time intervals, Aarogya Setu uses a static device identifier. This combined with the fact that Aarogya Setu collects several other data points including meta data, makes the app vulnerable to an attack where users can identify other users who have been determined by the app -rightly or wrongly - as high risk spreaders.
6. **Transparency**  
Clause 3 of the Terms of Service prohibits reverse engineering of the app which means that security researchers cannot independently study it to perform good faith vulnerability disclosure. The government has also refused to provide any technical specifications of the Aarogya Setu app. In contrast, other countries like Singapore, Israel and Australia have published the source code of their apps and other technical specifications relating to cryptography and bluetooth. 
7. **Accountability**  
Clause 6 of the Terms of Service exempt the government from any liability for a person’s inability to access the app, inaccurate information about COVID-19 status of persons in one’s proximity and any breach of user data. Clause 7 of the Terms of Service further states that the government makes no warranties about the app’s accuracy and that such services are never wholly free from defects, errors and bugs. 

### What happened at today's hearing?

The PIL filed by John Daniel was listed before a Division Bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman and Justice MR Anitha as Item No. 8 and it came up for hearing around 11:30 AM. During the hearing, the counsel for the Petitioner sought interim relief to ensure that no coercive action was taken against anyone for failing to download the app. The counsel for MeitY insisted that Aarogya Setu was the best app in the world and emphasized that a protocol had also been issued to address privacy concerns. The bench was disinclined to intervene at this stage because ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". However, the bench directed the government to file a statement on record that the data collected by the app will not be misused and listed the matter on 18 May. 

The Writ Petition filed by Jackson Mathew was listed before a Single Judge Bench of Justice Gopinathan as Item 71 and it came up for hearing around 5:15 PM. During the hearing, Justice Gopinathan enquired about the previous proceeding before the Division Bench. Advocate Santhosh Mathew appearing for the Petitioner explained that this petition was not a PIL and highlighted the practical difficulties faced by the petitioner who would have to purchase smartphones for his employees and check whether they were using the Aarogya Setu app or risk criminal prosecution. The counsel appearing for MeitY once again insisted that the Aarogya Setu app is supposed to help the government fight COVID-19 and unless a large part of the population downloads it, the app will not be effective. In response, Advocate Santhosh Mathew emphasized on the aspect of criminal penalities and noted that even the Registrar or Chief Justice could be liable for imprisionment if any of the High Court employees failed to download Aarogya Setu. Justice Gopinathan acknowledged that this was a valid concern and he directed the counsel for MeitY to get instructions and file a statement on these aspects. This petition will be listed next on 18 May along with the petition filed by John Daniel before the Division Bench. 

Advocate Santhosh Mathew and his team comprising of Advocates Anil Sebastian Pulickel, Vijay Paul and Jaisy Elza Joe led this important court intervention. Lawyers, Gautam Bhatia and Abhinav Sekhri, IFF retained counsels, Vrinda Bhandari, Devdutta Mukhopadhyay and Sidharth Deb also provided drafting and research assistance for this petition.

1. Liquidate it quickly.
2. Not be penalised too much when I withdraw (so stocks are out)
3. Am going to regularly deposit in it when there’s no emergency.",1589769746.0,"I’d say it’s a two-horse-race between Arbitrage, and an Overdraft.


Arbitrage Funds do just that, price arbitrage. Whether it’s between exchanges (BSE vs. NSE) or in the Futures market, they profit from the difference. Since trades happen near instantaneously, there is negligible risk. They also park funds in debt when they don’t see profitable opportunities. Consequently, there’s very little upside, between 6%-7% a year. The advantage for you is they are treated like Equity for tax purposes, so if you don’t end up touching your emergency funds for over a year, you pay 10% LTCG TAX above the first 1 Lakh. If you hold for less than a year, you pay 15% in STCG. Worth considering if you fall in an income tax bracket  > 15%


Depending on your bank, you might be able to get an Overdraft
against your Equity/Debt Investments, typically with a 50%-80% margin. You can withdraw from the overdraft as and when you need to, but you’ll be charged interest only on the sum of your withdrawal and only for the duration till you “top-up” the overdraft. The advantage is that you remain invested in the markets even during the period of emergency. Plus, since it’s against collateral, interest rates are much lower than credit cards and personal loans.


Seeing as you’ll keep depositing into this corpus even when there’s no emergency, no reason why it should be in a low-earning tax-inefficient instrument like an FD.


Guess it ultimately comes down to your age, tax bracket, and personal circumstances, whether it’s job security or any dependants you may have. If you’re into your 40s, in a lower tax bracket and are unsure of employment and/or have dependents, maybe FD is still the best. 


If not, then maybe these are two options to consider. "

My name is Andrew Juan, and I'm a high school rising senior who probably was the only high school student working full-time on the Yang2020 campaign, and likely any other campaign so far. 

Here's some background about me and the Yang campaign.
In April of 2019, I first learned about Yang, and I thought this dude was ridiculous. But then, I saw his CNN Town Hall and learned more about him. I wanted to get involved, so I join the Email Response Team, at the time, a very small group of people responding to emails sent in to the campaign.

I cranked out plenty of emails and was eventually hired as an intern, expanding my workload to various other tasks, particularly in Distributed Organizing and digital organizing. Then, around July/August, I realized, we needed a youth organizing branch. No other campaign had launched one yet, and I decided that we needed to be the first, so then, Youth for Yang was born, and I was hired as National Youth Director.

Our team grew and the members of Youth for Yang grew to almost 2,000 people! While the campaign did not end in favor of Yang, we continued the mission of youth engagement in politics by converting it to a nonprofit organization, dedicated to engaging youth in politics and promoting unity and bipartisanship. You can learn more about our organization [here](https://yacu.org).

Check out my proof (and my Twitter account) [here](https://twitter.com/AndrewDJuan/status/1267500158109077513?s=20)

All in all, my expertise is in youth organizing and engagement so far, but please, ask me anything!

Edit 1: Hey all, I'm going to be taking a brief break from answering questions at the moment, but please, feel free to continue. I'll respond to them sometime tonight! Thanks for all the amazing questions so far!

Edit 2: I'm going to be able to answer some more questions, but not all of them. Just want to note, the opinions expressed here are solely mine and not representative of the Yang campaign, the YACU, or any other organizations I'm involved with.

Indian land, labour, agriculture laws are all uncompetitive and were created in the socialist era. They are not suited for the modern day, nor do they help with modern day issues. Companies don’t want to go to a country where land acquisition is convoluted and difficult, and where government permission is needed to lay off even a single worker, even when you are literally going bankrupt. And that’s only a fraction of the issue with these laws. 
There is desperate need for reform in these sectors, otherwise we are going to keep lagging behind in growth to these countries. 

It feels quite frustrating when you realise that  Bangladesh actually has a LESS free economic environment than India does in so many sectors. India has a greater ease of doing business, is actually less plagued by corruption, has much freer markets in so many areas etc. yet Bangladesh has been recently clocking higher growth than India almost solely thanks to its export oriented textiles industry.

I'm not saying every protester or protest is the same, but what I have heard has really troubled me and I wanted to share. Hearing the vulgarity of how people refer to one another (even if they disagree), hearing how they want to put people on trial, seeing posts made in social media encouraging people to go loot and rob people's homes in suburban areas, hearing cries to burn things down, even going so far to justify the looting and rioting. The shaming of people who do not kneel. The list goes on and on.

I have never felt so much racial hatred and divisiveness in this country like I do today and I see a certain force in this movement driving the racial divide even more, pushing that all white people (regardless of who they are simple because they are white) are guilty and need to apologize and dividing people even more into confined racial groups. It was MLK that said after all that it was his dream that his children be judged not by their skin color but by the content of their character, yet today I see this movement apparently against racism going against the spirit of MLK, they are not judging people based on their character but on their skin color and from that there is this aggressive push for retribution. 

I do not believe this hate and racial divisiveness can bring any good unfortunately.  I think this may even make the problem worse: for everyone. There may be legitimate problems to address, but with this rhetoric, this shaming, this hatred, I only see those problems deepening with time. This will fuel even more racial hatred as people are shamed for simply being born with their skin color and forced to submit to the demands of a wider and more violent mob. 

I'm an immigrant and I always appreciated the freedoms of the USA and how it's a country that has welcomed so many immigrants to build it. But I have never felt such pessimism and a desire to leave the country till this very time. I know people are trying to make change they believe will make the country better, but I see a reflection of past histories that didn't turn out well. The justification of violence and hatred, the suggestion of ""trials"" and dismantling reminds me of how Bolsheviks justified their violence to come to power, and there are so many more such examples in history, one just has to read them. Many people also believe that defunding or even dismantling the police entirely will solve the problem, yet in such anarchy, it will not be the good or just people that will be ruling; it will be powerful ones who rule with force and with violence at any cost, and where the law doesn't rule, rather their threat of violence supersedes it all. This is how human nature is and history has shown this. Stay safe.",1591593411.0,"Next, someone will call this guy ""a Russian"" and talk about how Putin caused the rioting next. /s

S is for sarcasm. I get you! It's confusing. Definitely Blacks get discriminated against and then they get resentful and think it's ok to do crime because ""slavery"" long before they were born. 
Then white people get ""played"" with the guilt trip card and subserviently say it's ok that black people do crime because of ""slavery"" but then white people move out of the city due to actual fear for their lives while talking ""white guilt"" at the same time. 
But worst of all we have racist cops who get racist because they only see the worst of black culture but not the majority law abiding black culture that's copying the whites by also moving out of the city because of crime. 

Even more confusing is that much if not most crime is done by blacks in the city but cops were going after peaceful black and white protesters while only a few police were going after looters. So that makes BLM look like ""black looters matter"". Finally, peace has returned and cops and protesters see violence doesn't work. 

You lost me though when you ranted about ""Bolsheviks"". No comparison then. Bolsheviks had a war going on that was killing and starving millions of Russians (WW1 not WW2 which was even worse) that makes NYC at it's worse look like heaven. 

A admit I think BLM's rhetoric is cringe at times and will probably re-elect the worst President ever. But I support police reform and BLM's goals anyway. But the rhetoric is not helping. "

The current modeling for COVID is so divergent from reality in many states that it can only be assumed the data is highly flawed. For example, the models projected many states to have 3-4x as many hospitalized COVID patients as we do now, assuming full lockdown protocols. Instead, you see hospitals that are half empty and furloughing a significant portion of their employees.

What most people fail to realize is that ""flattening the curve"" *does not mean we make fewer people sick.* It means we make the same number of people sick as would happen with no lockdown, but it happens over a longer period of time to avoid overwhelming the hospitals. If your state has all of its hospitals going out of business because there's no patients, it is absolutely irresponsible and ignorant to not begin easing some of the restrictions.

Take Florida for example. Their governor just eased restrictions, citing massive differences between the models and what the state is experiencing in reality. 
>The state has had more than 27,800 confirmed coronavirus cases and 867 deaths. But DeSantis said that hospitals have plenty of empty beds, and that predictions that they'd overwhelmed never bore out.

>“There were estimates that this week, Florida would have 455,000 people hospitalized for COVID-19,” DeSantis said. “The actual number is closer to 2,000. We've been able to flatten the curve.”

### Tl;dr

Popular file-sharing service service, ""WeTransfer'' has been blocked by a direction issued by the Department of Telecom (DoT). This has reportedly been done in the interests of, ""*national security and public order*"". Today, we sent a representation to DoT urging them to recall this direction. We further also indicate the need for wider regulatory reforms that have led to questionable blocking orders in the past. Including the blocking of Telegram and Porn Websites in India. This is at it's very threshold a transparency problem. To address it we are in addition to the representation opening up our RTI resources to the public to facilitate greater transparency.

### WeTransfer blocked

WeTransfer is a popular file sharing service ([**link**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wetransfer#section-funding-rounds)) used widely in the creative and legal communities in India for sharing large files. It has even been as late as 2017 been used in press releases on the Press Information Bureau by the Ministry of Defence ([**link**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1509516)) and the Ministry of Food Processing Industries ([**link**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1508193)). 

Today, we sent a representation to the Department of Telecom to address a direction issued by it to block the popular file sharing web service, “WeTransfer”. This was first reported by Reuters by it’s report dated June 1, 2020, titled, “India asks internet service providers to block WeTransfer” ([**link**](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-india-ban-wetransfer/india-asks-internet-service-providers-to-block-wetransfer-idINKBN2381JC)). This report was substantiated with several posts on social media by WeTransfer users who further directed us towards a  statement by WeTransfer dated on May 27, 2020 ([**link**](https://wetransfer.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044171371-WeTransfer-is-currently-unavailable-in-India-)). To address this specifically, we have taken a range of steps. 

When we heard the first press reports on June 1, 2020 itself we filed a RTI.

The second step we have taken is to send a detailed representation to both the Department of Telecom and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology ([**link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N83zCT-ZTCcfyGMLugdkXHEJZtkX0clU/view?usp=sharing)). But more on that later. Through our active community the actual blocking directions was shared with us susbequently. While we cannot at the moment vouch for its authenticity it seems credible to us. The Order *first* matches all the data points in news reports (also does not contradict them) and *second* it is similar to prior blocking directions which we have studied in the past.

### Analysis of the WeTransfer Blocking Order

It gets a bit technical here, but please bear with us! A short analysis of this blocking dated May 18, 2020 bearing reference number No. 813-7/25/2011-DS-Vol.VII (Part - I) (“the Order”) reveals the following deficiencies :

1. **Issues of transparency:** As a threshold issue, the Order has not been pro-actively published and hence there exists a large amount of confusion amongst the large base of WeTransfer users in India as the website is being inconsistently blocked across ISPs throughout India. Such publication is a necessity not only as per the inferences which follow from the judgement of Shreya Singhal \[[**link at Para 109**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/110813550/)\], but also the directions made by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the judgement of Anuradha Bhasin \[[**link at Para 152(a)**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/82461587/)\] made in the context of directions for suspension of telecom and internet services especially for availing judicial remedies.
2. **Lack of reasoning:** The Order does not contain any stated reasons but directs that three URL’s to be blocked. These include two subdomain links which have expired as WeTransfer links for it’s free service makes such links inactive 7 days after creation. The third link is the parent domain of WeTransfer. There is an absence of any reasoning on the material contained on this link or how the service provider itself is in conflict with extant laws and regulations. An absence of any reasoning makes the Order appear mechanical and lacking an application of mind.
3. **Reliance on UA License:** That the Order merely cites License Condition 7.12 in Chapter IX of the Unified License ([**PDF Link**](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Unified%20Licence_0.pdf)). The License Condition states the following, “7.12 In the interest of national security or public interest, the Licensee shall block Internet sites/Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)/Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and / or individual subscribers, as identified and directed by the Licensor from time to time” . It is relevant to consider that provisions for website blocking are also contained under Section 69 of the Information Technology, 2000 with a defined procedure under the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking for Access of Information by Public) Rules, 2009 (“Blocking Rules”) ([**PDF Link**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Information%20Technology%20%28%20Procedure%20and%20safeguards%20for%20blocking%20for%20access%20of%20information%20by%20public%29%20Rules%2C%202009.pdf)). The blocking rules, provide for a detailed process for prior-notice, providing reasons (while they have severe legal deficiencies) provide for a latter, more specific and detailed process of the same power under the grounds of, “national security” and, “public interest” thereby being a more developed regulatory mechanism.

### Transparency is a threshold problem : For eg. Telegram 

The process of website blocking as noticed in this specific incident is a wider issue that has impacted popular internet based messaging application Telegram.

Working with Avinesh, one of IFF's many community members who first filed the RTI to understand the reason why Telegram's web domain was blocked in India, we had preseed for further transparency by filing a first appeal in March, 2019. Unfortunately the Department of Telecom is yet to respond to her.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4euuedvrpt351.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a1d02f9fadce22e71cac199a91ee9f9a2748a6

**Transparency is a real problem.** 

It undermines the public’s rights to receive information and even contest and approach court to seek restoration. We have also noticed a disturbing trend where that website blocks often emerge from Court Orders that may be premised in directions under Public Interest Litigations and overbroad intellectual property enforcement (top-level analysis of 4000 URLs blocked under court orders[ **link**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-tale-of-rogue-pirates-ashok-kumars-and-isps-caught-in-the-middle-rti-data-on-court-ordered-website-blocking-reveals-worrying-trends-whattheblock/)). For instance, court based directions and vague directions by the Department of Telecom have led to the blocking of porn websites which are legal as a private exercise of consumption by Indians (analysis of blocking of porn websites[ **link**](https://internetfreedom.in/whattheblock/)).

### So what is IFF doing to address website blocking of WeTransfer?

We are focussing on the problem of website blocking with a range of advocacy actions which increase chances of reform and success. In addition to creating public literacy materials like this update, and even a video explainer we are first addressing the immediate issue of the blocking of WeTransfer. 

Towards this we have sent a representation to the Department of Telecom ([**link**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N83zCT-ZTCcfyGMLugdkXHEJZtkX0clU/view?usp=sharing)) calling on it to undertake the following steps: 

1. **Recall the Order:** Specific to WeTransfer, we urge for the Order to be recalled and if grounds exist then a fresh process may be initiated under the Blocking Rules with proactive public disclosure and an opportunity for WeTransfer representatives to make thier case in defence. Such transparency will further confidence in the exercise of the regulatory power and further provide a right to members of the public to avail judicial remedies given the impact on the fundamental right to receive information.
2. **Restrict use of, “national security”:** Grounds of, “national security” must not be utilised from overzealous Intellectual Property claims. There has been a tremendous growth of court orders that are often passed without adequate public disclosures when users attempt to access such services premised on allegations of infringement. Such claims cater to the private economic interests of large corporations. They are not within the traditional understanding of the security interests of the Government of India and undermine the intent of such power which are to be used solely in the defence of our national interest.
3. **Start a process for reform:** As a solution, we urge for stepping towards institutional reforms, through an interdepartmental consultation that provides for public inputs on the issue of the reform of Website Blocking. This is especially important given such blocking regulations are antiquated, present a threat to not only the fundamental right to receive information (even Network Neutrality protections in the UA License given discretionary blocking by IPS’s), but also causes significant economic impacts for entrepreneurs and users (such as creative professionals who widely use WeTransfer for transferring large file sizes). Further regulatory confusion exists due to overlapping laws which occupy the same field and provide for divergent processes.

### How can we address the wider problem of website blocking?

As we have noticed, there is a threshold problem of a lack of transparency in Website Blocking in India. 

* **A public transparency capacity:** Towards this later today, we will be opening up our growing capacity on transparency which is being implemented through RTIs and data side projects (on Section 66A cases and facial recognition deployment). At present this capacity is limited to one staffer and has been privately offered to digital rights researchers. We will outline principles that will help us to strategically offer this resource to maximise impact and supplement research and advocacy by the wider digital rights community in India.
* **Strategic litigation:** Before parting, we would also like to indicate that IFF through it's team of lawyers and pro-bono counsels is presently conducting a strategic litigation on this very issue in the High Court of Delhi. This is the case of the website blocking of Dowry Calculator where we are representing it's creator Tanul Thakur ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/meity-defends-blocking-of-satirical-dowry-calculator-website/)). 

Finally, we do not see these actions as adversarial to the Government but with a view towards much needed regulatory reforms. Without prejudice to this litigation, we will continue good faith attempts to engage with all public bodies and government offices!

But, we all know how aggressive China's been playing for a while now. China is also heavily investing in India's neighbourhood. Their alliance with Pak is well known. It appears that Nepal is also under heavy Chinese influence, just today I read this news : [Nepal schools make Mandarin compulsory after China offers to pay teachers' salaries](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/nepal-schools-make-mandarin-compulsory-after-china-offers-to-pay-teachers-salaries/articleshow/69799114.cms)

China's attempts to influence Maldives through its so-called ""debt diplomacy"" are also well known. In Sri Lanka, they have taken the Hambantota sea port on a 99 year lease. China-Myanmar relations are solid as ever.

It appears that Bhutan and Bangladesh are the only two neighboring nations right now that don't seem to be overtly under overt Chinese influence. Even from these 2, Bhutan is the only one that seems to be solidly on our side.

So, is it time for us to consider that we might be being encircled? Please try to keep responses serious and on topic.",1592266195.0,"We get it. India has historically been invaded and conquered by foreign powers. So you guys have a national trauma that has manifested into showing yourself as a superpower (and that is not exactly a bad thing...and India is indeed a superpower; especially if we have to talk about the rest of the subcontinent). 

And what happened, the death of an Indian national at the hands of Nepali border police, is indeed tragic and should be investigated and condemned. 

But ya all need to chill and stop spouting nonsense like Mandarin being made compulsory. It is being taught only in few schools that received donations. And regarding the border issue, ultra-nationalism sells on both sides. The Nepali government can make new maps and claim Kalapani-Lipulekh and heck, even the entire subcontinent, but it means jackshit unless any other power recognizes it. 

India is still the nation with most influence in Nepal. It is geographically impossible for Nepal to close its ties with India (after all, we are bordered by India on three sides) and strategically a suicide. Many Nepalis work in India (a sad reality that Nepalis cannot ignore). And just like how Indians have the national mentality of being seen as a superpower, the Nepalis have a national mentality of playing the victim card; so much that we can sum into the formula of Anti-India = Nepali Nationalism.  

And is it not true that the India-Bangladesh-Myanmar proposed oil pipeline has been put on hold many times because the Indian government refuses to pay proper amount to Bangladesh (even though all three nations would benefit)? Is not that the reason why Myanmar is selling its stuff to China instead? India's foreign policy of treating its smaller neighbors like vassals instead of partners is also to blame for the China trap. Of course, the ruthless Chinese government mostly bribes leaders to agree to its demands but still.  

And the way your media talks is war-like and hawkish (don't even try to deny this). Protests against Oli government happen regarding rise in taxes and lack of testing; no Indian media has to twist that into its own narrative of ""Nepalis protesting against the new map made by the commie government"". And a few comments here as well act like as if they are all eager for a pointless war. 

One day, the idea of nation-states will disappear. But that day is nowhere near right now. And for now, the sad reality for us here is that we Nepalis do not have our own national policy. It is to be a pawn in the game between two Asian giants. I know everyone is at fault here. But perhaps India can be the bigger man by adapting its foreign policy and preventing its media from acting like a bunch of baboons spouting nonsense. 

You know what I think? I think the Indian government and media is butt-hurt they cannot do anything about their border tensions with China and instead making the Kalapani thing a big issue (ignore the Nepali nationalists; they still have unrealistic dreams of ""Greater Nepal""). The Indian government could have just ignored the issue. Like I said, Nepali government can claim those disputed areas (and the entire subcontinent) but it will amount to jackshit unless others recognize those claims and we *de facto* control those areas.

**Demo**: [Demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

If you’ve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

390,A look at Aarogya Setu through the Right to Information lens,239,greub8,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/greub8/a_look_at_aarogya_setu_through_the_right_to/,False,35,Policy/Economy,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u70sbajgb9151.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1922f3262263d86c840f4fa6d1c8fa0c1ec93f6e

**Tl;dr**

Since its launch on April 2, 2020 the Aarogya Setu application has been embroiled in privacy and data protection related controversies. However, while these have been the primary concerns, much has also been written about the lack of transparency around the application. IFF has filed multiple Right to Information requests with various governmental authorities to extract all relevant information. In this post, we will highlight these requests, the substantial replies that we received as well as the non-answers which also tell us a lot.

**Background**

On [**April 2, 2020**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1610301) the Aarogya Setu application was launched by the Government of India. It claims to be COVID-19 tracking mobile application which has been developed in public-private partnership by the National Informatics Centre(NIC) that comes under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology(MeitY). It has been developed with the help of a group of unnamed volunteers and the NITI Aayog. Since it is collecting health data related to COVID-19, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is also a stakeholder.

**What did we ask?**

IFF has filed multiple RTI requests with NIC, NITI Aayog, MeitY and MOHFW to extract information about the Aarogya Setu application and the developments surrounding it.

**RTI requests filed on April 4, 2020**

In our first round of RTI requests we asked the NIC and MOHFW about:

1. The legislative framework, rules, guidelines or policies authorizing the use of the Aarogya Setu application.
2. The kind of data collected by the app.
3. The storage duration of the data collected from quarantined persons.
4. Exhaustive list of government officials who will have access to this data.
5. Persons/organizations with whom this data will be shared.
6. The specific security safeguards which have been put in place to protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable details of persons in quarantine and their data.

We also asked them about the government-appointed expert panel that has been formed to monitor the data being captured by the Aarogya Setu application.

**In the reply that was sent by the MOHFW on April 21, 2020, they said that they did not hold any such information related to the Aarogya Setu application and transferred the request to NIC**. It is inherently problematic that the MOHFW does not hold any information about the application which has been publicised to have been providing essential health services. (Read IFF’s initial tweet thread on the replies received [**here**](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1254729501839245314)) **They further transferred the request to MeitY who also claimed to not hold any information with regard to the application and transferred the request to NIC**.

We received a reply from NIC on May 7, 2020 in which they also failed to adequately respond to our queries. (Read IFF’s initial tweet thread on the reply [**here**](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1258393390758031363?s=09))

https://preview.redd.it/9s0y3zoib9151.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=65097600aef9862afca0f2ef188ba15c08d80bf9

In response to the question about the legislative framework which authorizes the use of the application, NIC transferred the specific request back to MeitY. Since MeitY has already stated in their own reply that they do not hold this information, this could mean either wilful flouting of transparency norms contained in the Right to Information Act or mismanagement due to lack of clarity on their part. Both these situations are less than ideal.

In response to the question about individuals and/or organizations who will have access to the health data collected, NIC replied that “The information from the Aarogya Setu App is used by the officials who are involved in COVID-19 related efforts.” This answer does not satisfy the query we raised in which we asked for an exhaustive list of such officials. Such vague answers are also not ideal since they leave the ambit too wide and essentially do not answer the question asked. It is also pertinent to note here that in the since published Protocol which provides legal basis to the application, it was stated that access will also be provided to third party researchers.

**Subsequent RTI requests**

In subsequent RTI requests we asked NIC, NITI Aayog, MeitY and MOHFW to disclose the names of the group of volunteers who developed the Aarogya Setu application filed on April 29, 2020. We also asked them to reveal the [**source code**](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1258334950442414080) of the application in a bid to increase the transparency around it in RTI requests filed on May 7, 2020 . It is pertinent to note here that all these requests are being transferred from the authorities we filed them with to the NIC.

Additionally, an IFF community member filed a [**RTI request**](https://twitter.com/internetfreedom/status/1260584436489506818) dated May 6, 2020 in which they asked for the source code of the Aarogya Setu application. In NIC’s reply dated May 13, 2020, they refused to reveal the source code citing S.8(1)(d) of the Right to Information Act which states that:

*Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen information including commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party, unless the competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such information.*

This could mean that the application may be exploited in the future for some commercial use. It also means that certain commercial/proprietary rights may be vested with the third parties themselves. Since we do not know the names of all the volunteers who were involved in the development of the application, this brings into question their motivation for volunteering to build the application. However, in a clear departure from its previous stance, yesterday MeitY issued a [**public statement**](https://twitter.com/SetuAarogya/status/1265281058532016128?s=09) in which they said that the application will be made open source. [**The source code of the application was made available on Github by the Government at 12 AM on May 27, 2020.**](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/centre-shifts-stance-releases-source-code-for-aarogya-setu-app-6428741/)

**RTI Requests on the Protocol**On May 11, 2020 the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the *Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020* (“The Protocol”). This Protocol has been introduced to provide legal basis to the application and depositions have been made by the Government in the [**Kerala HC**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-aarogya-be-made-mandatory-kerala-hc-asks-centre/story-pQxvF6Tb7PPXtAoVMAsGDJ.html) pursuant to this. (Read our analysis of the protocol [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-studied-the-protocol-and-no-this-doesnt-sufficiently-protect-your-privacy/)) On May 13, 2020 we filed an RTI request pertaining to the Protocol. In it we enquired about the composition and the members of the Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management who were involved in drafting the protocol. We also asked if any legal opinion was sought to draft the protocol. We also filed a RTI request with IIT Madras asking about their involvement with the application since it was indicated in official documents that they have access to the data collected through the application.

The Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy has been involved in drafting the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 which provides a legal basis to the application. They have also published an [**explainer**](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/2020/05/11/aarogya-setus-data-access-and-knowledge-sharing-protocol-2020/?utm_content=bufferad954&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer) on the Protocol. Subsequently, there was talk among the community that they have also shared a legal opinion with the Government.

https://preview.redd.it/m9iruiljb9151.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ecaa0e9b9b0dcc9d870ebd6790b097c693c61fe

On May 25, 2020 we filed a RTI request on the basis of this tweet by Vidhi’s Research Director asking for a copy of the legal opinion provided by him or other employees of the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy. We also asked for a copy of all the subsequent correspondence that took place between the government and Mr. Lalitesh Katragadda and Mr.Rahul Matthan, who have been identified by Mr. Sengupta in a previous tweet as having been involved.

We will be following up on all these subsequent RTI requests according to the mandated timelines and will be doing a follow-up blogpost on the topic.

**Why is transparency important with regard to the Aarogya Setu Application?**

Right to Information requests help in facilitating government transparency which then helps individuals in asking for accountability. The Aarogya Setu application which is collecting the health data of millions of Indians needs to be accountable to these individuals. However, the Government of India and the various governmental authorities who have been involved in the development and deployment of this application have failed to disclose relevant information about the application. In failing to do so, the government opens up the application to questions regarding its legitimacy.

Since there was no public debate which was held before the deployment of the application, it becomes even more imperative to ensure that accountability is demanded from the government by mobilizing mechanisms such as the Right to Information Act. The Government has a legal responsibility to provide satisfactory responses on queries raised under this Act failing which further action may be initiated by concerned individuals and organizations.

I personally don’t agree with these re-education camps myself. Its an overreaction and just isn’t right but at the end of the day it isn’t America’s problem.

The main issue behind all of this is that while Xinjiang belongs to China, historically it has been home to Turkic peoples very similar to Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Kyrgyzstanis, etc. 

These peoples, the Uyghurs, call this region East Turkestan. There is a significant percentage of Uyghurs which want independence from China. There’s even a jihadist organization called the ETIM (East Turkestan Islamic Movement). While most people in Xinjiang aren’t involved with this organization, China has pretty much adopted a zero-tolerance policy against separatism/terror. 

So they’ve forced hundreds of thousands, if not a million, of these Uyghurs in these re-education camps to force these people to develop loyalty towards the Chinese state. "

Somebody working 4-8 hours has more free time to enjoy life and thus spend more money in the market. You think somebody working for 10-12 hours daily will be able to do that? 

Here is simple stuff:

The harder we work for our money, more we sacrifice, more we sacrifice, more we save that money, more we save that money, less we spend and circulate it back into the system. Essentially creating a very toxic circle and soon enough, initially we lose small industries eventually leading hits to big companies bringing down entire economy. 

It has been proven again and again that sitting in office for longer hours is actually bad for economy. Yet, when I see discussions around it, no one discusses this. We need to speak about direct negative effects of this. 

The rise of technology actually allows us to work less and yet produce more. This age old idea of working more means more production didn't have the technology we have today.

>""sorry, we are seriously offended by China because we think it created & spread coronavirus; hence, we have decided to shutdown our 2 billion$ plant in China; build another one in India which will finish construction after 5 years at a cost of 4 billion$ because laws and land acquisition is easier in China. Also, we will make 3$ profit per product instead of 4$ because transport and raw material is more expensive in India. Because of this, you investors will lose 400 million$ per year for the next 5 years. There is also a possibility of bankruptcy. But at the end of the day this is the just thing to do.""

You will get kicked out instantly. Even if you are the owner of the company you wont just waste millions of dollars just because the country did something unjust.

Stop being delusional guys. Really.

Outside of places that actually got hit with a significant number of cases, like Ontario and Quebec, it was very easy to drop cases as Rt never went above 1.

Both Ontario and Quebec have messed up their lockdowns. Especially Ontario. They opened up prematurely (stage 1 and stage 2 were progressed to prematurely), which directly set back stage 3 (which is a proper mainly full opening). Stage 1 prematurely set back a proper opening by about a month, and stage 2 is likely to set back a proper opening by about another month. The economic benefits of those 2 months being more open than the lockdown were insignificant: even though they allowed some people to go back to work, until stage 3 is reached, many people/businesses cannot open, or at least not make meaningful income/profit, and so the premature openings forced these 100s of thousands of people/business that require stage 3 to open/make reasonable income/profit to continue not working, and take CERB for another 2 months, which we will have to pay back with higher tax rates for the rest of our lives and which also damaged the economy. So any gains made from a premature stage 1 and 2 opening were cancelled out by pushing stage 3 (a proper opening) back, and on top of that, dozens more lives were unnecessarily lost in those 2 months.

So did the lockdown ""work?"" Obviously it worked to an extent, but was it done efficiently and did it minimize death and economic damage to the extent that it would have had common sense been applied as opposed to pandering to anti-lockdown voters (who erroneously think that health and economy are mutually exclusive, and don't realize that a premature opening damages the economy more as well as causing more hospitalizations and death, as explained above) by opening prematurely? No, at least not in Ontario.. "

It's been six weeks and the first item that she ""shipped"" still hasn't arrived.  Even worse, you asked for a tracking number for the first shipment, she claimed not to have it, and then *she didn't get a tracking number for the replacement shipment either*.  Honestly, she sounds either like she's totally incompetent, or she's a scammer.  Either way, she's failed to deliver the item you bought, *twice*.

525,Housing Market Crash imminent?,64,gh9a0i,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gh9a0i/housing_market_crash_imminent/,False,61,Policy/Economy,"I have been doing research on the housing market in India.
Lets take the first source:
https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/02/09/the-economist-house-price-indices
Sadly, India only has House Pricing Index available since 2009,
but what this still tells us is that India has seen the highest % increase in nominal prices (nominal = not adjusted to inflation basically?) in the last decade and honestly, I didn't need to see the data for this, I have seen examples all around me.

Current House Price/rent ratio in india goes above 50 years in metro cities. I thought this might be the case across the world but found out that cities in USA have this around 10-15 years (and they are no longer in a housing market crash btw and have almost recovered since the last one).


For the last decades, housing has seemed like a safe investment to everyone in India despite it making no sense when you compare the ROI in terms of rent, but everyone seems to justify it with ""prices will keep increasing and it will be worth it"". This is typical market sentiment right before a market crashes (consider any market).

Another indicator of market top would be that recently we have seen tons of unsold projects in major Indian cities.

If your argument is that ""India has too much population, so prices can never fall"", well you are wrong there. Housing is a speculative investment just like any other and if your argument was correct, the rent prices would be just as high as well.


Not financial advice, but i would definitely wait for a market crash before even considering to buy one.",1589172542.0,Damn this thread is depressing. Should I just buy gold 
526,Opinion | How Modi Failed the Pandemic Test The starkest failure of the Indian government’s coronavirus strategy has been the devastation it imposed on the country’s workers.,161,grey7v,india,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/opinion/india-modi-coronavirus.html,False,19,Policy/Economy,,1590592698.0,"Of course, it is from 'Hartosh Singh Bal', from 'Caravan magazine' and even I knew without even reading it what the opinion will be.

> It may suggest the success of the Indian government’s strategy, but the almost similar trajectory of spread of the virus and fatality rates in Bangladesh and Pakistan suggests that other factors have had a considerable role to play.

What almost similar trajectory is he talking about? There is minimal testing in Pakistan and in Bangladesh most of the testing is concentrated in Dhaka. But why is he comparing India's testing with   Pak and Bangla, and not with other countries when he himself quoted earlier in the column that India's grown rate is much much slower than US/UK? He absolutely is cherry picking his stats to back his pre conceived narrative.

>Of the 30 countries that have registered more than 25,000 coronavirus cases, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are among the countries with the lowest levels of testing per million

Cannot speak of Pak or Bangladesh, but India went into this knowing that there is absolutely no way we can scale up testing to cover a billion people with the kind of infra we have. The strategy was always to test people to identify hotspots and deal with it, not individual testing. 

Everything else he wrote in the post is true. The lockdown granted the center/state governments 60 days to ramp up whatever was needed to handle the pandemic and the situation arising from the ensuing lockdown, THEY DID NOT. Modi, along with Kejrival, Mamta, Thackrey's, KCR, Jagan, and many more failed to live up to their constitutional duty. All of them are equally culpable and not including them with Modi's name is giving them a pass. "

Will the group be around to service the Namo smartphone if and when it runs into issues is anyone's guess.

> ""We are from land of Gujarat & in electronic smartphone business in China,"" the group says. ""Our product is our way of dedication & respect to our great nation leader. We will be launching NAMO Android handset with Shri Narendra Modi ""signature edition"", for which process in under way! We will launch our handset very soon... for updates please see our FB page.""

## Tl;dr

Earlier today we facilitated a legal challenge to the Noida Authorities to revoke the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu under a threat of criminal imprisonment. As per a legal order those residing or entering Noida have been compelled to install Aarogya Setu. Failing to have Aarogya Setu on your phone would be criminally prosecuted under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. To contest this egregious breach of personal liberty, we commenced proceedings of challenge through Ritwik who is an advocate based and residing in Noida. We are making the contents of this representation public to facilitate more people to file similar challenges to Section 144 orders which may arise in different parts of India.

## A path to health, or to jail?

The Government's contact tracing app *Aarogya Setu* literally means a path to health. But [as we explained](https://internetfreedom.in/45-organizations-and-105-prominent-individuals-push-back-against-the-coercion-of-aarogya-setu/) those who do not install it now risk being criminally prosecuted. This is through a direction issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on which more than [45 organisations and 100 individuals](https://internetfreedom.in/45-organizations-and-105-prominent-individuals-push-back-against-the-coercion-of-aarogya-setu/) have asked for an urgent review.

To make this direction actionable, the Noida administration issued an order under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 compelling those residing or entering Noida to install Aarogya Setu failing which they would be criminally prosecuted under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. This order was also tweeted by the Police Authorities. A copy of it is linked below.

We have [detailed concerns and recommendations](https://internetfreedom.in/a-comprehensive-look-at-covid-surveillance-and-privacy-in-india/) on the privacy and second order injuries caused by [Aarogya Setu](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/). To us it is a, ""privacy minefield"". From the lack of legality and safeguards there are good, practical reasons ([such as it's impact on the battery life of users](https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/voluntary-aarogya-setu-now-mandatory-in-noida-fir-rs-1000-fine-or-6-month-jail-if-app-not-downloaded-1674635-2020-05-05), or[ just not having a smartphone](https://thewire.in/law/aarogya-setu-smartphones-noida)) why many people will refrain from having Aarogya Setu. To put is plainly, to criminally prosecute people for not installing a smartphone application even at the time of a pandemic is illegal. Due to this, we were compelled to take steps to challenge this order.

## A Section 144(5) Challenge

To activate a challenge to this order, a terse representation was drafted today by Abhinav Sekhri, Advocate to activate a legal process to ensure the personal liberty of all residents of Noida and those who may be seeking to enter it.

This representation is made under [Section 144(5) of the CrPC](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/930621/) by Ritwick a Advocate and a resident of Noida. The primary grounds of challenge are as follows:

1. **Contrary to law:** Section 144 Orders cannot impose positive obligations on persons to do certain acts, such as download and install an App on their Smartphone, but only direct them to “abstain from a certain act”. Reference may be had to a decision of the Calcutta High Court in *Emperor* v. *B.N. Sasmal* \[ILR (1930) 58 Cal 1037\] where orders under Section 144 directing a person to leave the district were struck down as illegal, and the Court noted that “*The very reason why the section uses the language ‘abstain from a certain act’ is just because it is not intended to empower magistrates to make positive orders requiring people to do particular things*.” This position was also upheld in *Ramanlal Patel* \[1971 Cri LJ 435\].
2. **Contrary to fact:** The Impugned Order is also contrary to fact. It is clear that the Advisory issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs requires 100% installation of the “Aarogya Setu App” within Containment Zones and nowhere else (Para 3 of the Advisory). The entirety of District Gautam Buddha Nagar has not been declared a “Containment Zone” as per the notifications issued by the State Government, but only a “Red Zone”, where 100% installation of “Aarogya Setu App” is not required as per Lockdown Directives.
3. **Violation of privacy and personal liberty:** The Impugned Order amounts to an unconstitutional breach of the fundamental right to privacy secured under Article 21. The “Aarogya Setu App” collects personal data in the form of medical information to which a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches as identified by the Supreme Court in *K.S. Puttaswamy* \[(2017) 10 SCC 1\]. Any sharing of such information requires clear consent, which is missing from prohibitory orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. which work on a threat of prosecution.

## A ready template (but, not legal advice)

To enable more people -- not only residents of Noida – to prefer similar challenges we are making a copy of this representation available in google docs so it may serve as a template for necessary action. While this does not constitute legal advice, we hope it accelerates the pace of citizen collaboration to safeguard individual privacy and personal liberty.

We will actively work to ensure that such orders that imperil you do not go unchallenged. As a public centered organization, IFF will conduct rapid responses and relentlessly champion your right to privacy through this pandemic.

Developers do way, way more than typing code. And even “brick and mortar” companies with a good digital strategy (eg banks, supermarkets) will do better than companies that don’t have one. Even in automotive, the quality of your software is now a critical factor. Then there’s Tesla, which many automotive companies still sneer at but doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon.

And for his exhortations to come work on the shop floor — well, maybe you should pay better. The sad reality of life is that usually the people “typing code” get paid a lot better than the people on the shop floor.

And before anyone waxes too lyrical about the Indian motorcycle industry — worth remembering that a large motorcycle market is uniquely an emerging market phenomenon and  has lots of road safety issues. Interestingly even Nigeria now has banned motorcycle taxis from many routes in Lagos and (via Wikipedia)

> China's domestic motorcycle market has suffered a downturn in recent years due to the banning of motorcycles in many Chinese urban centres

This is not to denigrate the good work Bajaj et al have done in India, but just to point out that motorcycles have lots of issues and India has unfortunately not regulated motorcycle use, to the detriment of road safety in India but — happily for Bajaj — allowed them relatively unrestrained growth.

Despite much fanfare around the Institute of Eminence tags, the Indian universities have once again slipped in the world university rankings ([QS world rankings](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2021)). 

|University|2021 ranking|2020 ranking|2019 ranking|

Several other initiatives have also been taken such as: **Education Quality Upgradation and Inclusion Programme (EQUIP), Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) by 2022, UGC’s Learning Outcome-based Curriculum Framework (LOCF), Graded Autonomy to Universities & Colleges, Global Initiative for Academics Network (GIAN)** etc.

Some would say that these rankings are biased towards the western universities. But I would urge you to NOT look at the individual ranks, and rather at the changes in ranks of each year. We witness a consistent decline for almost all Indian universities.

Key points from the article:

*  The top five Indian Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institute of  Science have all dropped in this year's QS World University rankings.
*  Total number of Indian institutions in the top 1,000 global list has also fallen from 24 to 21. 
*  “The slight drop in rankings of some institutes is because of the  parameter of internationalization,” a senior HRD Ministry official. India performs poorest on this parameter, while scoring well  on research impact, measured through citations per faculty. 
*  We also score poorly on faculty-student ratio, because we only count  full time faculty, whereas American universities include Ph.D. students  who are teaching or research assistants.
* Mixed bag for elite private universities. Prestigious names- BITS Pilani and Vellore Institute of Technology dropped out of  the top 1,000 list. OP Jindal Global University, new entrant last year, climbed to the 650-700 band.",1591803900.0,"Our institutions also have to worry about being affordable, which western universities do not.

I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old medical student taking a leave of absence to run for the U.S. House of Representatives because the establishment has totally failed us. The only thing they know how to do is to think small. But it’s that same small thinking that has gotten us into this mess in the first place. We all know now that we can’t keep putting bandaids on our broken systems and expecting things to change. We need bold policies to address our issues at a structural level.

We've begged and pleaded with our politicians to act, but they've ignored us time and time again. We can only beg for so long. By now it's clear that our politicians will never act, and if we want to fix our broken systems we have to go do it ourselves. We're done waiting.

I am running in Michigan's 12th congressional district, which includes Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Dearborn, and the Downriver area.

Our election is on August 4th.

I am running as a progressive Democrat, and my four main policies are:

1.	A Green New Deal 
2.	College for All and Student Debt Elimination 
3.	Medicare for All 
4.	No corporate money in politics 

I also support abolishing ICE, universal childcare, abolishing for-profit prisons, and standing with the people of Palestine with a two-state solution.

Due to this Covid-19 crisis, I am fully supporting www.rentstrike2020.org. Our core demands are freezing rent, utility, and mortgage payments for the duration of this crisis. We have a petition that has been signed by 2 million people nationwide, and RentStrike2020 is a national organization that is currently organizing with tenants organizations, immigration organizations, and other grassroots orgs to create a mutual aid fund and give power to the working class. Go to www.rentstrike2020.org to sign the petition for your state.

My opponent is Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She is a centrist who has taken almost 2 million dollars from corporate PACs. She doesn't support the Green New Deal or making college free. Her family has held this seat for 85 years straight. It is the longest dynasty in American Political history.

While the US Military doesn't adhere to the Ottowa treaty, it has taken tremendous strides to eliminate collateral damage from minefields, especially with regard to anti-personnel mines (the kind that are most likely to maim civilians).  It has VERY strict procedures surrounding mine employment in general.  All mines (both anti personnel and anti tank) are surface laid (as opposed to buried) and minefields must be clearly marked on all four sides with frat fence and signs.

The mines themselves have self-destruct times measured in days, or tens of days.   Once the times have elapsed, something like 99.9% of the mines will harmlessly self-detonate. Any that don't detonate are supposedly inert to begin with.

This is much ado about nothing.  If anything, it serves as a mild deterrent to NK and another tool in the kit for combatant commanders to help ensure border security, but one which (given past history) will almost certainly not be used.  The risk posed to any civilians from this policy reversal is virtually zero. "
591,Did you know that you can withdraw cash from your credit card at 1.5%?,0,h7p42l,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/h7p42l/did_you_know_that_you_can_withdraw_cash_from_your/,False,5,Business/Finance,"You can withdraw cash using credit card using Cred's RentPay application.

**Why this is helpful?**

If you want to withdraw cash from your credit card in case you have a cash crunch. You can withdraw cash from ATM too but that would attract interest upto 2.5% of cash withdrawn as a interest  + 30% interest is levied since date of withdrawal till bill is generated. So make sure that you're not using credit card to withdraw cash from ATMs.

622,My Concerns on UofM Reopening,84,hbi5nc,uofm,https://www.reddit.com/r/uofm/comments/hbi5nc/my_concerns_on_uofm_reopening/,False,100,COVID-19,"To start, I feel like I should say I’m not sure if this is a rant or if I am trying to convince people of something or what.

EDIT: This post is long and a commentor suggested it would be better to put the TLDR at the start rather than the end: 

TLDR: I personally believe that it is not safe nor is it worth it for the school to reopen at all in the Fall and that everyone would be better served if UofM stayed online. I highly recommend you read the full post but I included this for those who may skip this post entirely otherwise.

Recently on this subreddit I saw a poll about how concerned people were about going back and I saw about 71% of the vote (521/729 when I saw) were either “Cautiously Optimistic” or “Excited!”. While I understand people’s enthusiasm and I share the desire to go back, I feel like the University is not ready for an in-person semester — even a limited “public health conscious” semester. Many public health experts have criticized states for reopening too quickly and right now it looks like numbers are flattening out, however I believe that very soon — because of the early reopening — numbers will start spiking again and that could create problems.

Some may just see this as fearmongering, and I don’t think we should be afraid of the virus but there is going to be a second spike or “second wave” the rush to reopen just expedited that process — even though the State of Michigan may have been slow to reopen other states were not and many students at UofM are not from Michigan and therefore they could bring germs back.

Some may use the argument that the majority of students are not in the high-risk group. However, just because we are in our twenties and we are in the low risk demographic doesn't mean young healthy 20, 30 etc. year olds haven't died. More than that, I don’t think “not dying” should be our standard, being intubated or moved to the ICU can be a physically taxing and mentally traumatizing experience and COVID-19 can absolutely destroy a person’s lungs/organs even if it spares them.

Furthermore, Schlissel laid out that anyone who gets sick will be quarantined, however that misses the point that at this moment we do not know exactly to what extent asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission play a part in the spread of COVID-19.

Think of how many students live in the dorms, the school is not about to give every single on campus student their own single room this semester. Dorms by their very nature are incubators of disease, if you're in a triple and you get sick you could spread that to the other two people in your room and they could spread it to anyone they meet before anyone shows symptoms and that is how an outbreak could start. I have heard of some schools addressing this problem by getting hotel rooms for their students; however, assuming UofM even has the capability to do that students who live “on campus” would still need to go to dining halls in long lines (even last year when take out service started the lines were still long) to get their food which again is dangerous and could spread disease.

I am aware that a hybrid semester would mean limited in person instruction and that since in-person classes will be limited there should be less interaction so this situation should be less likely, however I would wager that most people are still going to meet up with friends and even if everyone avoids meeting friends or going out to eat etc. some interaction will definitely happen assuming lab classes and discussions are in person as well.

So far there's no data to show how often asymptomatic patients spread the disease so even if we have smaller in person labs, or smaller in person lectures it's still dangerous considering how people move and spend their time on campus.

I saw in a recent subreddit post that Schlissel said UofM will implement contact tracing and test every single student when they return to campus. 1) Nowhere in the United States has managed to implement contact tracing so how exactly will UofM do that before we return — especially if they are looking to lose 400 million to 1 billion dollars 2) Even without a testing kit shortage where is UofM going to acquire about 46,000 tests (if not more accounting for spares) before we get back and 3) how exactly would 46,000 students get tested in a way that isn't either a logistical or public health nightmare? Furthermore, UHS would be the main place people go to get treatment and they tend to already be packed during a normal semester let alone a pandemic semester.

And winter only makes all these problems worse, people not going outdoors means more people in enclosed spaces where droplets can spread between people easily. Assuming COVID is seasonal (which technically is irrelevant because seasonality does not affect pandemic viruses in the first year due to the lack of an immune population), the virus would also be able to stick around in the air longer making chances for infection even more likely.

All of this fails to mention that Winter is also Flu season, which by itself without any other major disease outbreaks, usually causes hospitals to exceed their capacity. Could you imagine the nightmare if UofM hospital had to deal with Flu and COVID Cases occurring both among students and people that are normally serviced by UofM? Some have argued that winter would be better because people would not want to go outside anymore, however this would make everything much worse not better.

This would mean either UofM would endanger all of our lives and our health by keeping us around past the start of flu season or we would be sent home after a partial in-person semester and I question how that would be worth it because that would put everyone in the exact same situation we were in back in Winter 2020. Everyone moving in during fall and then moving out either at the end of fall semester or earlier during Thanksgiving is wildly more dangerous than nobody moving in or out at all — just spare a thought for how many people you interact with during move-in/move out. And if you’re planning to go through airports that would mean going through congested security lines only to then board a metal tube where you will be sitting in close proximity to at least 100 other people for hours.

Some might read this and say “well if you have an issue you can stay home” and that’s fair. If I decide I don’t want to come back I won't — but I’m not writing this post about me I'm thinking about the people who feel like they don't have a choice and come back, student athletes told to come back because UofM wants to make some money to recoup their losses from the pandemic, or the people that come back simply under the assumption everything is safe and they will be fine.

I feel like we have to just accept the facts instead of trying to force an in-person fall semester because it’s dangerous. I am aware other schools are doing in person semesters as well, notably MSU, but UofM doesn’t have to follow the trends.

Yes, fully online is the harder way out, both for UofM financially and for the students. If they went fully online, some people would not come back and some people who wouldn't be able to afford a gap year will be forced to have a worse education -- which is not nothing -- but such is the time we live in.

I agree being home is boring as shit, some people have tough and abusive home situations, and almost everyone wants to be back at Michigan rather than stuck at home for any more time. However, we are at war right now and we all need to play our part — the thing about wars is that everyone needs to make sacrifices and our sacrifice is going to be our comfort and the quality of our education and while it sucks I think it’s something we have to do for the greater good.

Not to mention, part of Schlissel's assumptions for the “public health informed semester” is that people will follow a ""social compact"". In my opinion, that assumption is too optimistic and to some extent it is naïve unless he has some way of enforcing it -- which even then that's a stretch because how exactly will UofM follow around 46,000 students to make sure nobody breaks the compact.

I would remind others who were on campus during the start of the shutdown this past Winter 2020 semester that Rick’s and other bars were filled and many students continued to go to parties even as we were being told to shut down and quarantine.

Some might argue, that UofM wants us to come back because they are concerned about our education. I would contend that the UofM Administration (not the professors mind you, the executives that make up the upper levels of administration) does not care if our education is good or bad as long as they are able to recoup part of their expected 400 million to 1 billion-dollar losses which is why they want us back so badly.

Although preferably they wouldn't have us on campus at all, part of fall might be fine. But having any number of students back on campus is an inherent risk than not having them at all. If the school reopens in any regard for normal students that means they will definitely bring back student athletes even if most normal students have their classes online.

Bringing back student athletes is already in motion, with UofM announcing a process for them to come back. Student athletes are not even paid by the school yet now will be asked to put their lives on the line just because UofM wants to make a dollar? It is shameful and disgusting for them to tout how much they care about their athletes and how much they want a safe process yet still are trying to participate in the NCAA this year.

Yes, I know they are again in the low risk group especially since they are at peak physical health. However, I would reiterate that being low risk does not mean these athletes can’t get sick with COVID-19 and are immune to severe cases and COVID-19 does not have an agreed upon treatment and is not as well understood as a disease like the Flu.

Furthermore, even if UofM does a television only season for sports like (for example) football those athletes will still have to interact with a very large group of people in close proximity: Teammates, coaches, coordinators, TV production crew, refs, the other team who may have traveled from another state and could have brought the virus with them. Even that fails to bring up the fact that football is a contact sport.

Recently Beijing shut down their sports stadiums despite being one of the first places to recover from the first wave of the virus. Another recent story was the UFC having 3 positive cases after attempting to continue fights back in May.

Some might say, “well if the NCAA reopens, we have to participate” and I just don’t feel like that’s true. Yes, it would create issues, but if UofM cares as much as they claim about their students and by extension the student athletes then they would temporarily withdraw from the NCAA or at the very least not participate in some of the major sports like football even if they’d lose money – because that’s what putting students first looks like.

We cannot allow the University to put our lives second in the name of saving money first. Some might bring up that UofM needs the money otherwise it could damage our education in the future if not put UofM in financial peril. While I am aware currently colleges are fighting for their very existence because of the financial pains brought on by COVID-19, I believe UofM will be fine whether or not we come back. The endowment fund for UofM is 12 billion dollars and 22% of that is just return on investments made. Our endowment fund ranks in the top ten out of all colleges across the United States. I am aware the endowment fund is not a bank account and you can’t just take money out of it on a whim, but this is still is evidence of the financial solvency of UofM.

On top of that, while Schlissel and other executives have taken pay cuts, one person they have not mentioned is Erik Lundberg who is the manager for the endowment. His salary in 2018 was 720,000 plus 150% of base pay. In 2016 Mr. Lundberg made more than 2 million dollars.

Others will argue that the reason for us coming back is to save the jobs of those lowest in the pecking order.  However, I would argue that by coming back while we would save their jobs, we would be putting their lives at risk by having them working in an environment that by all accounts is more dangerous than if the school was not open. Furthermore, it is the University’s (and honestly if we are being real it’s really the federal government’s responsibility) responsibility to provide for these workers.

I don’t expect UofM to keep every single worker on their payroll because while that would be great it is not realistic; however, I do believe that the executives should take a bigger pay cut. Recently Schlissel and the Chancellors of Flint and Dearborn took a 10% pay cut despite the fact their salary is around 900,000, 400,000 and 437,000 dollars respectively meaning they only took cuts of 90,000, 40,000 and 43,700 each even though their UofM salary does not include other forms of income like stocks, assets, book deals, money for speaking etc., and use that extra funding in order to provide payment to low income UofM workers who may be out of work due to the pandemic.

I personally have considered starting a petition, writing letters, etc. to the school to tell them to stay shut down and to focus their resources on creating a better online experience since the COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be completed by sometime next year. If not that extreme, at least a petition or letters or something telling the school to cancel big fall sports like football. However, I have held off on that because it seems as though public support seems to be for reopening and it feels pointless to even try.

As a FIRE (Financial Independence and Retiring Early) enthusiast myself living in India, one thing that I have realised is that the importance of passive income cannot be understated! 

The problem being that just like with FIRE reddit threads, most of the content related to passive income generation is either from first world coutries or those that leverage internet giants like Amazon, fb etc. using affiliate marketing, drop shipping etc. 

In view of the above, I thought it would be a great idea to create an open community exclusively for people in India or those who have stayed in india in the past or are planning to relocate in the future who either have already developed their passive income streams in India or are aspiring to do so in the future! 

It is for them that I present r/passive_income_India community. While this post is not exactly a general Reddit community launch post, but it is in a sense related to exclusive Indian ecosystem and hence I am posting it here to reach out to those interested guys who I may not find on other local specific reddit threads. Further, I feel this is the right thread where maximum reach can be made to relevant people present on reddit who might have interest in the topic. Presenting r/passive_income_India !

I have been using this god awful, horrible, and atrocious Siti/Indinet (more like S*ITTY) broadband for 5 years now at this point. When I first got the connection, I wanted to opt for something like Airtel or Alliance broadband as I heard from my friends that they are pretty good. Airtel straight up denied and Alliance LCO redirected me towards the Indinet LCO. I simply got a cat5e cable to my house from a switch hung up on a pole by a road near my house (it's still the same). Nothing else...

My Experience With Indinet:

Now packet loss, downtime for days, bad routing, request timed outs (both from LCO and the ISP side), in-game packet loss, and more got me pretty fed up. Netflix doesn't go to 4k, Prime video doesn't hit the highest resolution available and stay there, Hotstar keeps buffering... I am just done with this BS. The LCO is also extremely rude, always says it's my router's or PC's fault when the problem is in his end (I have an Archer C9, so should be a decent enough router), and has done many more bad things. We paid for a Siti cable set-top box while installation, and when we switched to DTH, he simply came to our house and took the box (that WE paid for) and went away. No one said anything.

He used to take 35 rupees higher than what he actually recharged for the plan including GST and warned us against doing online recharge (their portal is bad enough anyways). So how did I figure it out? I don't know how, but one day, on the play store, I stumbled upon the My Indinet app (pretty astonishing stuff). So I logged in using my mobile number and OTP. On the invoice section, I could see all of my invoices and my neighbors invoices for whatever weird reason (seems like a massive breach of privacy but whatever I'm getting offtopic). There I saw what was the actual amount he recharged for every month including GST. When asked for it, my LCO replied it's taxes. He stopped replying when I reverted that those recharges were including the taxes. But whatever 35 rupees right? No big deal so my parents kept on paying him that. He kept up the malpractice for couple more months until I sent Indinet a long email with screenshots of my actual my Indinet app receipts and LCO given receipts. Even then, forget a refund, a rude employee called me from Indinet and said, ""It's a common thing within operators. They take this for a 24x7 service. Stop crying like a lil bitc* (they used some Bengali swear words and this is the best translation I can provide). And a 24x7 service my as*, I didn't even get internet 15 days out of the 30 days I pay for.

They shut down their services as soon as they see some clouds on the horizon. And all the users here in Kolkata would know about the thunderstorm around evening most days in this season. And once the internet goes down, it ain't coming back till next day noon. And I had a static IP at first. When I didn't need it anymore, I decided to stop paying the 3000 od rupees I pay every year for it, thinking my nat type would at least stay on Moderate, enabling me to play online multiplayer games on consoles. But NOPE, Xbox and PC jumps between Teredo unable to qualify and Strict and server connectivity blocked (with high latency and packet loss), nat type 3 on PS4, and D on my Switch. I can't even join any Minecraft server on PC. CSGO, Fortnite have become unplayable because of the packet loss. Rainbow six siege, division 1, and 2, pubg lite, COD, Battlefield IV, and V, Battlefront II damn near every multiplayer games I have played regularly on PC, I have faced problems. Forget about console games as they won't even connect...

Me and my friend used Parsec and when I had a static IP, it used to work perfectly fine. Then my friend moved and got S*itty broadband (previously he was on Alliance). And around the same time, my static IP package finished. And we couldn't normally connect to each other on parsec. We started using Zerotier and that worked for a while. Then my friend had to move again and got back to Alliance broadband. Since he switched to Alliance, the latency has always been above 500ms (unusable) on Zerotier for some reason, and without Zerotier it doesn't even connect. I know that it's a Siti broadband's problem because my other friends from other ISPs (Airtel XStream fiber, Jiofiber) also got the same thing trying to connect to me.

I switched to an over 100mbps package a couple of years ago. I didn't get the full speed because of the 100 Mbps switch used by the operator. When the operator recharged, he didn't tell me that I wouldn't get the speed because of that. I had to pay 3000 rupees extra to the operator for a gigabit switch to get over 100 Mbps (Yes I had to pay during the first installation and multiple wire changes as well). For that, he promised me once he lays OFC (which he said was gonna happen soon), I won't have to pay for that. Two years later, still waiting for fiber...

When I seriously started working online, I requested other ISPs countless times. But no one would enter my area. I called Airtel once again to request an Xstream fiber connection. Their backend team called me and told me that they once had their connection available in my area. But other LCOs and cable mafia drove them out. And mostly they didn't put up a fight because of a low number of users in my area. When I begged them for a connection and told them that I am ready to pay the cost of the cable (I thought the distance would be about 1KM, but it was much higher than that), they just laughed and told me that if I am ready to pay around 500000 rupees (including wire and manpower), I can get a connection.....

At this point, you guys might be thinking why didn't I got to the district consumer court against my LCO and Siti... Believe me, I really wanted to. Well, my parents didn't care before as they didn't use the internet at all. Then when we stopped DTH as well and all of their content became internet-based, they started getting mad as well at the downtimes, and the quality drops (no kidding the quality would drop below 480p on Netflix, Hotstar, and prime video sometimes). I found out about the central government PG (public grievance) portal a couple of days ago. I have lodged a complaint there... Let's see what happens...

TLDR: NEVER EVER GO FOR SITI OR INDINET.

I called up the Alliance LCO once again and he basically told me this: They got multiple requests ('leads') from our area and forwarded them to Alliance. They got permission to lay wires from the corporation. But my LCO stopped them. They apparently have this ""mutual agreement"" that one LCO doesn't enter other's area. When I said that this should be illegal, and one broadband company can not have a monopoly over one area, the Alliance operator told me that it IS illegal. But no one cares. Not even TRAI or the DOT. Then he said, ""Suppose you pay me 20k for the connection including wires and all. Now to go to your area, the fiber cable has to go through two different LCO's areas. Now if one of the LCO cuts the wire, you would have to pay that 20K again. How many times are you gonna keep paying that? It's just not sustainable. And I don't really wanna tussle with your Indinet LCO and his goons."" Then he gave me the number of a nearby H Fiber LCO.

Now I called them and visited their office back last year. I saw that the same LCO provides Hathway, Alliance, and H Fiber all together which seemed pretty weird. At first, they denied, then they agreed to look into it. Later, he said that if I need a new connection, I can only go for H Fiber. And he would give me a direct connection. He's gonna use two gigabit Fiber MCs (media converter), one on my end, and one on his, and run OFC in between (about 1km). And he said the whole setup would cost me around 15k. Should I go for it? And I got the confirmation from him that even if my current Indinet LCO cuts or breaks the wire, he would handle it. Not me. He seemed like somewhat of a better person than my current LCO, I don't really know...

Then he just stopped receiving my calls and I just gave up... Because of 5 days of constant downtime and no one coming to fix anything, I started spam calling him again a couple of days ago. He finally picked up and told me that he can give me the connection as soon as the lockdown would be over by 20th May (if the lockdown gets lifted on 17th, which I don't think it will but whatever). I asked him if it's possible to give me the connection within the lockdown as broadband service should be an essential service. Apparently some of his men went to jail for providing a new connection and they got a notice stating that they can do maintenance on their existing lines but they can not provide new connections. I don't know if that's true or not, he assured me that I will get the connection. Is there any downside to using media converters? Also, if there's any H Fiber Kolkata user here, please tell me about your experience with H Fiber. Do you get at least moderate nat? What are the downtimes like? I am especially scared because I heard that they started using Jio gateway. Now, I don't really care about blocked websites as I have Nord for that. Is there any other downsides to that?

PS Sorry guys about the long rant and the horrible formatting.",1588620601.0,"Been with Alliance for about a year. For one year, I didn't have any issue, and the downtime was less. Only during thunderstorms they would cut the wire and then after it was fine, the connection would be back. As I understand, they do that to protect their equipments.

The pings have been decent too, lesser than Jio LTE (4G+), mostly about < 100 ms. And no more than 200 ms in nearby servers.

Their customer support is decent. Always calls me within 15 minutes after registering the complaint and always been polite and understanding. 

But, since past couple of days, the download speed has been hugely affected. On my 60 Mbps connection, only to their own servers, the result comes around 60 Mbps (on direct connection), but on all other sites, I get about 2-7 Mbps, which never happened before. And this happens especially after evening. The ping and upload speeds are unaffected though. Not sure about the cause though. Sent them a complaint today. Let's see what happens. 

About your LCOs being mafia, unless they are really dangerous people (like murdering people), you should send them a legal notice. Most of such people only roar like lions, but are cats inside. Just pick up a fight, invite others too to pick up a fight, too.

&#x200B;

> If there's any H Fiber Kolkata user here, please tell me about your experience with H Fiber. 

I have never used it. In fact, never heard of it, too. So, don't know. Sorry. "

# (Please don't reply with logics and modern economic principles, we abandoned those craps in 2014).

# *************************************************

If we really want to make India truly ""Atmanirbhar"", Indians must stop working for foreign IT companies and start working for national companies.

You will be shocked to know that IT companies pay 5 to 10th portion of profit they make from you and keep the rest. Think, for once, we are sending equal amount of money to foreign nations by working for foreign companies as we are sending by buying foreign products. If we decide to work for a national company, the Indian company will get the same projects and all profits will remain in India.

Today is the opportunity to kick off this revolution because other than India, there is no country with such abundance of IT talent. We can stop thousands of crores from going outside India if our youngs decide that they will work only for an Indian company. All manufacturing units in China are owned by Chinese : employment as well as profits , both remain in the country.

This can't be achieved until foreign companies are in competition, and sadly, these foreign companies are in competition only because of our own Indian talent.

One more important thing needed to be done is to top providing Arab and Chinese companies with high quality IT services. If Indian IT guys deny providing them services, they will be needed to hire from other countries at much higher costs. I don't need to say much how these countries use these savings against India.

On side , we have foreign IT companies and on the other side we have people like Ajim Premji, Ratan Tata and Narayanmurthy who have donated thousands of crores in Covid19 itself. Has any foreign IT company matched such donations ?

People will say jobs are created which are good for economy, so by this logic foreign products also help create jobs in retail economy. Don't fall for these arguments.

5 मिनट देकर एक बार इस दिशा में भी सोचे :

देश को आत्मनिर्भर बनाना है तो सबसे पहले विदेशी आईटी कंपनियों की नौकरी बंद करना होगी और देश की कंपनी के लिए काम करना होगा।

आपको जानकार हैरानी होगी विदेशी आईटी कम्पनिया कर्मचारियों को 5 से १०वां हिस्सा देती है और बाकी का मुनाफा खुद रख लेती है।  एक बार सोच कर देखिये ,जितना पैसा हमने विदेशी प्रोडक्ट्स खरीद कर विदेश भेजा , उतना ही हम विदेशी कंपनियों के लिए काम करके देश की कंपनियों का नुकसान  करते है।  जो प्रोजेक्ट एक विदेशी कंपनी को मिलता है , वही प्रोजेक्ट हमारे यहाँ की TCS  या Infosys को मिलेगा, और पूरा मुनाफा भारत में रहेगा।

अभी तो मौका भी है क्योकि दुनिया में किसी और देश में आईटी के सेक्टर में हुनर की इतनी उपलब्धता नहीं है जितनी भारत में  है।  अगर हमारे युवा निर्णय कर ले की सिर्फ देश की कंपनी के लिए काम करेंगे , तो हजारो करोड़ रूपये भारत से बाहर जाने रोक सकते है।  चीन में जितनी भी मैन्युफैक्चरिंग यूनिट्स है, वो सारी चीनी है, रोजगार भी देश में और मुनाफा भी।

इसी तरह एक बार अगर विदेशी आईटी कंपनियों की जगह हमारी भारतीय कंपनियों को प्रोजेक्ट्स मिलने लगे और मोनोपोली बनने लगे तो उसके बाद ज्यादा मुनाफा भी वसूला जा जा सकता है।

पर जब तक कम्पटीशन में विदेशी कंपनियां है ये असंभव है, और बड़े दुःख की बात है की वो कंपनियां कम्पटीशन में टिकी है तो सिर्फ और सिर्फ हमारे देश को टैलेंट के दम पर।

इस तरह से भारत में लाखो लोग जाने अनजाने में हजारो करोड़ रूपये का फायदा विदेशी कंपनियों का कर रहे है जो की पूरी तरह से भारत की कंपनियों को मिल सकता है अगर हमारे आईटी के होनहार इंजीनियर एक बार दृढ़ निश्चय कर लेंगे की अपनी सेवाएं देंगे तो सिर्फ भारत की कंपनी में।

एक और महत्वपूर्ण बात ये भी है की अरब या चीन की जिन कंपनियों के लिए हम उच्च गुणवत्ता की आईटी सर्विसेज मुहैया करा रहे है  वो काम अगर भारत के इंजीनियर मना कर दे तो झक मार कर उनको 5 से 10 गुना कीमत ज्यादा देकर कहीं और करवाना होगा। ज्यादा बोलने की तो जरुरत नहीं है की ये देश इस बचत का क्या करते है।

क तरफ एक विदेशी आईटी कंपनी ने भारत की सुध नहीं ली और दूसरी तरफ अजीम प्रेमजी, रतन टाटा और नारायणमूर्ति जैसे लोग है जिन्होंने COVID19 में ही  हजारो करोड़ दान कर दिए।

लोग कहेंगे की जॉब्स क्रिएट होते है तो उस लॉजिक से तो फॉरेन प्रोडक्टड्स से भी रिटेल जॉब्स क्रिएट होते है , ऐसे मूर्खता पूर्वक तर्क में न फसे।

तो दोस्तों , आज ये निश्चय करलो की चीन का कोई प्रोडक्ट हमारे मेड इन इंडिया से भले ही सस्ता हो, पर हम खरीदेंगे मेड इन इंडिया ही , और विदेशी कंपनियों चाहे जितना इन्क्रीमेंट देकर बुलाये, हम काम करेंगे तो देश की कंपनी में ही।

As an OBGYN resident doctor, I realised the lack of credible and evidenced based information about pregnancy and contraception to women directly. As doctors we want you guys to have a ton of information but we don't really have a lot of time to run you through all this.

Soooo I developed a completely free (ad free! bias free! random product advertising free! affiliate link free!) app to track vitamins, sonographies, doctors appointments; answer all your FAQs, ideal diet, prenatal yoga exercises, updates on growth of your baby, how to deal with everyday problems in pregnancy and when to ask for help and go to the doctor immediately.

This app also tracks your periods, tracks your birth control pills, gives you medical valid information about different methods of contraception, and answers your FAQs

This app is available in English, Hindi and Marathi because I didn't want ANY indian woman to miss out on knowledge just because she is not comfortable with English.

I'm doing this because as an OBGYN I truly believe that we need to empower ourselves and this is only done when the correct information is given to YOU.

YOU are in charge of your body.

Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",1586014075.0,Finally!

What are these protests for?

We’re protesting the systemic racism that is overwhelmingly impacting the lives of black Americans. 

What evidence do we have for this—strap yourselves in:


Black people are 3X as likely to be shot and killed by police over white people despite the fact that they are 1.3x as likely to be unarmed compared to to a white person.

https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/

Here’s a 2017 FBI chart showing incarcerations. https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-43 

Black Americans make up 13% of the population and white Americans make up 76%

Yet there are 2.2 million black Americans incarcerated but only 5.6 million white Americans incarcerated. Proportionally speaking that doesn’t make much sense.

“Oh but aren’t Black Americans responsible for more violent crime?” 

If by responsible, you mean overwhelmingly blamed for it, yes, absolutely.

In fact, Black Americans account for 49% of all Wrongful convictions since 1989. That is to say they are exonerated because they didn’t commit these crimes in the first place. Think of that. There are 5.6 million incarcerated white people and 2.2 million African Americans. And Still they make up for 49% of wrongful convictions.

https://abcnews.go.com/US/african-americans-blamed-crimes-commit-experts/story?id=70906828



Some More statistics on why they are overwhelmingly fucked over by the judicial system in particular:



***Black Americans are 7x more likely than white people to be wrongly convicted of murder. 3.5x more likely to be wrongly convicted of sexual assault. And 12x more likely to be wrongly convicted of drug related crimes.***


https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/7/14834454/exoneration-innocence-prison-racism


Moving on, this source shows income inequality for Americans by race. The median household income for white Americans was 70K in 2018. For black Americans it was 40K.

https://www.epi.org/blog/racial-and-ethnic-income-gaps-persist-amid-uneven-growth-in-household-incomes/


Now here are three sources on how black Americans are disproportionately disadvantaged when it comes to education opportunities

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/segregation-school-funding-inequalities-still-punishing-black-latino-students-n837186

https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/02/concentration-poverty-american-schools/471414/

https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/01/28/us-education-still-separate-and-unequal


And Finally— Why not “All—Lives—Matter”? 


Here I will paraphrase from the great Michael Che. 

Imagine your significant other asks you: Do you love me?


And you respond: But baby, I love everyone! 

We are witness to the suffering, torture, oppression, and murder of millions of Black Americans for literally hundreds of years at this point. And STILL all the information I gave above is happening all the time.


Just from the Transportation during slavery alone 1.2-2.4 million people died. That is nothing to speak of what happened thereafter and nothing to speak of how many died when they were being kidnapped.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6445941.stm


You may think to yourself “but all this is in the past” No. It is not. 

Did you know that Lynching was made a Federal crime This Year? Lynching. Historically speaking, do you know who tends to get lynched? Black Americans.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/congress-makes-lynching-federal-crime-65-years-after-emmett-till-n1143626

Until the lives of Black Americans finally Matter in this fucking country, All Lives Cannot Matter. 

We Want for all lives to matter. But we have a Serious problem here.

We’re not asking for their lives to matter more than yours or anyone else’s. Just to Matter. Period. It’s not that much to ask for to say and acknowledge that they deserve as much dignity and respect as anyone else. It’s not a threat to your existence to want people to be treated right.


I could provide a fuckload more examples in just about every facet of American life, but that’s really not necessary. Just look for yourself. Please investigate whether or not black Americans are overwhelmingly disadvantaged for no good reason. You will most definitely find that this if the case if you Actually look. "

Our yearly budget is around 30 Lakh Crore. I am going to bet all my money that this newly announced economic package is not outside of this budget. And the new net spending that is truly a one-time spending would be substantially less.

And also, the PM has included the actions of RBI as part of the government’s “fiscal” package. Government expenditure and RBI’s actions are neither the same nor can they be added in this manner. For instance, when the US is said to have announced a relief package of $3 trillion (Rs 225 lakh crore), it only refers to the money that will be spent by the government — and it has nothing to do with what the Federal Reserve (US central bank) might have done.

[A rough estimate suggests that the RBI’s decisions have provided additional liquidity of Rs 5-6 lakh crore since the start of the Covid-19 crisis.](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/narendra-modi-coronavirus-economic-package-india-self-reliance-6406939/)

My  dad is a doctor and due to the COVID fiasco he has decided to shift his  practice to focus more on tele-medicine. So the first thing he wants to  do is to create a website that could act as a ""store-front"", so to  speak. He needs a website where his patients can book appointments, conduct video calls, send in their blood work via photo, buy their meds from the pharmacy (this isn't urgent), and have a hassle free transaction portal. I've decided I'd try help him out with this, which is why I'm  here.

How exactly would you go  about doing this? I've done a bit of research and so far I'm  understanding that you need a domain (he already bought one), and a host? He told me about a website called Wix but that seems more like a  web design site.

I tried advising  him to pay someone who knows what they're doing to do this, but he told  me that money is extremely tight and he also has to pay his rent and his staff, even  though he isn't operating right now.

Even if I did want to pay someone,  who would I look for? A web developer? Web designer?

If any of you have experience in this field please send me a DM.

Any help is greatly appreciated!",1590072624.0,Website you can use Wix. Practo has a solution for booking etc.

**Tl;dr**

In the midst of the current pandemic, internet access has become more crucial than ever. While the right to internet has not been recognized as a fundamental right under the Constitution of India, in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* it was held that the internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights. In this blogpost, we aim to highlight the access to internet problems being faced by the citizens of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and how this is affecting them particularly due to the pandemic. In this regard, infrastructural constraints mean the region is languishing with low-speed and prohibitively expensive internet connectivity. Such conditions lead to disproportionate and exclusionary outcomes. In this regard, the pandemic has also delayed the implementation of the  Chennai and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project. The CANI Project is meant to bring high speed broadband connectivity to the inhabitants and was supposed to be completed by June, 2020.   


**Current Situation in Andaman & Nicobar Islands** \- **INR 50,000 for Internet Access!**

Internet and telecommunication services in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are presently dependent on satellite connectivity and have access to limited bandwidth. This has led to unreliable internet connectivity as well as extremely high tariffs with one individual getting a bill of 54,902 INR for their broadband connection. Such figures are unfathomable considering how affordable prepaid and postpaid plans for unlimited voice, SMS and data services have become commonplace in India, in the last 4 years. 

&#x200B;

[**Internet connectivity is shoddy at best with there being no internet from 20th to 22nd May, 2020 due to the Amphan Cyclone.**](https://www.pennews.net/andaman-nicobar-islands/2020/05/22/amphan-cyclone-disrupts-internet-connectivity-in-andaman-for-more-than-24-hrs) Even when there is internet connectivity, it is slow at best with the combined bandwidth availability for Andaman & Nicobar Islands being only [**3.2 GBps**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1598968). For comparison, bandwidth availability in the state of Mizoram is 10 GBps.  Individuals on the islands have also complained of [**highly unstable and below standard connection speed, combined with high latency ranging between 600-1000 ms and packet loss as high as 90% cause failed loading of pages and broken downloads.**](https://debkumarbhadra.blogspot.com/2020/06/open-invitation-to-demonstrate.html?m=1)  


**The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation**

With the implementation of a nation-wide lockdown, people have become heavily dependent on the internet. However due to bad internet connectivity in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, the people of the islands have been left handicapped. In a [**letter**](https://twitter.com/JijithBJP/status/1260232212487659521) to Shri R.S. Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Communications. Electronics & IT, the State President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Shri Ajoy Bairagi listed down the problems which have arisen as a result of bad internet connectivity. 

**A.** **Education**

Students who are currently in schools and colleges across the country have been accessing their classes and resources online. However, the students in Andaman & Nicobar Islands are unable to do so. Additionally, students have not been able to do remote internships or any other skill building exercise. One of the worst affected are college students who are in their final year and have been unable to sit for remote placement interviews due to lack of or unreliable internet connectivity. Students have also not been able to complete online internal and semester end exams which has put them in a disadvantageous position compared to students hailing from other geographical areas who have better internet connectivity. Students who were planning to sit for competitive exams like CAT, GMAT, GATE etc. have also been facing difficulties in preparing for them due to not being able to access online resources. This has created demographic based inequalities with the people of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands being left in a disadvantageous position. 

**B.** **Online Financial Transactions**

The lockdown has put the country in the unique position wherein people are reluctant to move outside the protection of their homes. In this situation, online financial services have become indispensable because they allow individuals to carry out online transactions from the security of their homes. However, due to unreliable internet online financial transactions are not feasible. This has forced the people of the island to stand in long queues outside banks and ATMs which is not only highly inconvenient but could also be a possible danger to their well-being. 

**C.** **Video Conferencing**

With restrictions being placed on social and physical contact due to the ongoing pandemic, video conferencing has emerged as one of the foremost ways through which people have been connecting with each other. Video conferencing has become essential not only for those working at home who want to connect with their colleagues but also for relatives and friends as the only means of communication which allows meaningful connection. Mental health issues such as depression and loneliness due to isolation have become high priority concerns. One of the ways through which people around the world have been handling this is through an increase in video conferencing with video conferencing applications such as Zoom averaging [**300 million daily meeting participants by the end of April 2020**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications). However, internet connectivity issues have further increased the isolation issues of these islands which are already marginalized from the rest of the country.   
Other issues which have arisen due to the pandemic and lack of internet connectivity are difficulty in procuring healthcare services, implementation of e-governance initiatives etc.   


**The Chennai and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (CANI) Submarine Cable Systems Project**

Dependence on satellite connectivity and the problem of limited bandwidth can be solved by the implementation of a submarine communications cable system. [**A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the seabed between land-based stations to transmit telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean and sea.**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/chennai-andaman-submarine-cable-system-project-to-be-completed-by-2020/articleshow/72020886.cms) On [**January 9, 2020**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1598968), Shri R.S. Prasad, Hon’ble Minister of Communications. Electronics & IT and Law & Justice inaugurated the cable-laying work of the CANI Project. The cables are of four-fibre pairs, with the capacity to transfer 6.4 tera-bytes of data per second by each fibre-pair. At the initial stage of commissioning of the project itself, the islands are supposed to get a data speed of 400-gigabytes per second which is nearly 100 times of the existing capacity.   


The submarine cables were to be initially laid from [**Chennai to Port Blair**](http://www.newsonair.com/News?title=Project-of-laying-submarine-cables-from-Chennai-to-Andaman-Nicobar-Islands-to-be-inaugurated-today&id=377449) covering a distance of 1,450 kilometres. Afterwards they were to be extended to Rangat, Long Island, Swaraj Island, Hut Bay, Car Nicobar, Kamorta and Campbell Bay in the Union Territory, covering an additional distance of 800 kilometres. The works were expected to be completed by [**June**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1598968)this year. .   


The total cost of the Project is 1224 Cr INR. This [**project**](http://usof.gov.in/usof-cms/agreements/Agreement%20with%20BSNL%20for%20Provision%20of%20Submarine%20OFC%20connectivity%20between%20Mainland%20India%20&%20A$N%20Islands.pdf) is being executed by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF), Department of Telecommunications(DoT). The [**USOF**](http://usof.gov.in/usof-cms/usof-objective.jsp) aims to provide Universal Service to all areas of the country through network extension & stimulate uptake of the information and communications technology services. [**Section 3(1A) of Telegraph Act, 1885**](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Indian%20Telegraph%20Act%201885.pdf?download=1) defines Universal Service Obligation as :   


*“""Universal Service Obligation"" means the obligation to provide access to telegraph services to people in the rural and remote areas at affordable and reasonable prices;”*  


[**Japan’s NEC Corporation has been contracted by India’s state-owned telecommunications company Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to design, engineer, supply, install, test and implement the cable system.**](https://www.developingtelecoms.com/telecom-technology/optical-fixed-networks/8938-indian-cable-link-due-for-completion-next-year.html) The project has been divided into eight segments with Segment 1 (Chennai to Port Blair) and Segment 6 (Port Blair to Swaraj Deep erstwhile Havelock) being ready for operationalisation in April, 2020 according to a DoT [**circular no. 30-174-7/2015-USOF-BB(Vol.IX)**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HvzAEXlNs7b6MLjC365aeZApgfIBIqJT) dated 24.04.2020.   


However, commission of this project has been consistently delayed. This means that even though the two segments are ready to be operationalised they have not been put into a working condition as of yet. The reasons provided are that initially the commissioning of these two segments got delayed due to the cyclone Amphan which hit Eastern India in May, 2020. Post this, the reason for the delay is said to be the [**COVID-19 lockdown**](http://andamanchronicle.net/index.php/18878-undersea-optical-fibre-project-cani-now-a-distant-dream-for-islanders) with the timeline for the project now being extended a further six months.   


The President of the Andaman and Nicobar Bar Association, Shri Mohammed Tabraiz, has filed [**Writ Petition W.P. No. 5324(W) of 2020**](http://andamanchronicle.net/index.php/18968-a-month-after-spc-s-nod-on-commencement-of-cani-bsnl-a-n-islands-keeps-the-project-on-hold), before the Hon’ble High Court of Calcutta, Circuit Bench at Port Blair. The petition seeks to ensure that the Segments 1 and 6 of the CANI Project are operationalised swiftly. The next date of hearing for the matter is on June 11, 2020.   


**Access to Internet is essential**

The right to access the internet has not yet been recognized as a fundamental right. However, in [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/) it was held that the internet is a medium to exercise fundamental rights provided by the Constitution of India. The judgement states that expressing one’s views or conducting one’s business through the internet are protected under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution respectively. However, does the Government have a positive obligation to provide access to the internet?  


The [**National Digital Communications Policy (NDCP), 2018**](https://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/Final%20NDCP-2018_0.pdf) seeks to unlock the transformative power of digital communications networks - to achieve the goal of digital empowerment and improved well-being of the people of India. To this end the NDCP attempts to outline a set of goals, initiatives, strategies and intended policy outcomes. This policy has three missions, the first of which is “Connect India: Creating Robust Digital Communications Infrastructure”. The aim of this mission is to promote **Broadband for All** as a tool for socio-economic development, while ensuring service quality and environmental sustainability. The CANI Project is a step in the right direction to fulfill this mission since the project [**aims to increase socio-economic development of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands due to increase in economic activities including tourism.**](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1598968)  


**4G internet for all**

Prime Minister [**Narendra Modi**](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-in-port-blair-live-updates-3-andaman-and-nicobar-islands-to-be-renamed-today-1970027), in a speech given on December 30, 2018 in Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands has said that, “*The government is working to ensure that no corner of the country and its people is deprived of development”.* However, development in modern times is impossible without access to high-speed internet which is made available at reasonable prices. As seen above, the people of Andaman & Nicobar Islands are paying tariffs much higher than the rest of the country and still do not have continued access to the internet. This has put them in a disadvantageous position as compared to the rest of the country. Thus, there is a need for immediate intervention to remedy the situation and prevent it from becoming the root cause of problems which may have long term implications.  


Internet access is also necessary from a national integration standpoint as it will help in integrating marginalised geographical areas such as the Andaman & Nicobar Islands with the rest of the country.   


**Recommendations**:

1. The USOF division of the DoT must implement the CANI project according to pre-existing timelines, and if they are not able to do so they must make public the reasons for this. They should also then provide clear timelines in which they estimate the work will be completed. This should include an explicit last date by when the project is complete and a detailed timeline with expected benchmarks.
2. BSNL and NEC must highlight if they face any regulatory hurdles, so that those can be worked on by the DoT and the USOF division, BSNL and local municipal authorities.
3. Segments 1 and 6, which are ready for operationalisation according to DoT circular no. 30-174-7/2015-USOF-BB(Vol.IX) dated 24.04.2020, must start their trial period by commencing traffic testing. Any permission related hurdles which delay compliance must be resolved by the DoT expeditiously.
4. Since internet and telecom services are categorised as “essential services” in various government orders therefore this issue must be given that level of importance by both central (DoT) and local authorities (BSNL, Andaman).
5. In the interim, vulnerable populations should be provided with subsidised broad based internet based services/transaction opportunities at CSCs, kiosks, post offices, legal services authorities, cyber cafes, etc.
6. Funds should also be allocated under USOF and national/state disaster relief funds for subsidised access to internet connectivity and internet enabled devices. This includes suitable subsidies for all current BSNL users on the islands. Special subsidies can be designed for students, healthcare workers and senior citizens.

Even from safety perspective, it is absolutely stupid to allow non essential shops to run a pickup style model, as it encourages venturing out and making contact with someone. E-commerce is the **safest** option even for essential commodities in developed parts of india where e-com is rampant.

I live in red zone where majority of non essentials are barred from delivery. My PC will fail in a month and i cant order a new laptop which will hinder my work and might even cost my job (considering my stupid ass super-boss). I have a spare laptop but my father & mother both work their own shifts on the same.

Govt. is absolutely stupid to ban e-com of non essential in redzones, as definition of essential can vary. Just a few days ago, we were not able to buy chargers for our laptop/ mobiles. Sure the shops can do the pickup thing but people dont buy online just cause of varied selection of products, but also the discount they hold. I have stopped buying offline, clothes,electronics everything is just cheap online.

idgaf about store loyalty that boomers have. ""beta hum iss dukaan se 40 saal se rashan le rahe hai"". Im a person living from paycheck to paycheck, im gonna go for cheapest option.  Urggh i jst want to punch the guy in face who decided this was a good idea. My orders are pending and goverment is not even allowing amazon to fulfill prepaid order of non essentials.

You can normally tell generally what the penalty was for by the sign the referee makes ([link](https://laws.worldrugby.org/?signal_category=all&language=EN)). Guessing you are aware of that - but just in case. 

If you want to know specifically the player etc then will need to watch on tv or go on the match thread on r/rugby and ask ‘what was that for’ every time. Although that will get annoying pretty quickly given the new interpretations seem to mean there will be 30 penalties a game. "

How are you guys coping up with this. There are people who  have their data plan exhausted before 6pm
I thought I'd share my tips on dealing with this.
I am a heavy data user and I only have my mobile data plan.

The first tip is to exhaust your data just before it expires. You can exhaust it by downloading YouTube videos you know you are going to definitely watch in your recommendations on your Android phone. This is a very important thing even if you waste a 100mb of data everyday thats almost 40 minutes of YouTube every day.

The second tip is for people who live with their family ask them to share their data with you and exhaust their data too right before it resets.

If you are on PC trust me it takes time but I have downloaded(pirated) AAA games(66GB) entirely on mobile data.
You can similarly download/torrent movies from these websites.
Alternatively you could also download free courses from  https://freecoursesite.com.

Think of data limits like daily wages you have to save up every day so that you can spend a lot on one single day.
To save up means to download .
I have enough content(Tv shows movies ) that I can watch for 14 hours/ day  for 2 weeks straight in the best quality discernable on my laptop.I hardly require anymore data for daily entertainment I could finish my day in 1GB/day now.",1592230113.0,MTNL broadband 80mbps down.

As seen above, revealing options in select dropdowns requires special tricks. And input fields actually trigger sidebars (or dropdown?) in an already cramped box.

I'd give another fifteen instances of atrocious UI, but you get the gist.

If they can't even get the easier parts of writing a web app right, I wonder what sort of nightmare realm exists on the back-end.

There's of course the trend of forcing users to update their passwords every quarter or so. Do you append a number to your password and increment it? Well, most do, which is why it's such a shit form of security, and [advised against by NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05).

It doesn't have to be for everything but some small things. 

There are a ton of start up in the local space especially one brand I'm yet to try called Blue Tokai Coffee. They source everything and it seems like they directly connect the coffee growers to the customers. They seem a much better option for coffee lovers than Starbucks where their coffee is nothing but sugar syrup. Also a lot of them are in the health snack and granola bars business if that's your thing. Also there are a ton of ice cream places and food outlets on Zomato and Swigy. I don't think ordering dominoes or at Mc D once a while will harm anyone.

I'm practically surviving on indian brands food products right now with their frozen parathas and rotis and whatnot. I thought Amul choclate would be horrible but after I tried it, it's honestly better than most other chocolate out there. I hope Epigamia gets some love, their vanilla bean yogurt is amazing. 

The free markets give you the right to choose anything, but I guess we should also try things out once a while. I have had a micromax ""made in India"" phone and I swear it was shit, but also I have a samsung ""made in India"" TV and it's quite good. I don't know how well we will do this Atma Nirbharta thing but over the recent times I have shifted towards using Indian brands of guilty pleasure food because simply they make it better. Now if you think different it's fine, all I'm saying is that we should try it out before making our minds. Try to be adventurous for our dinner or lunch or dessert.",1590884005.0,They are crispier

I’m stuck here in my neighborhood with only walking and running for outside exercise and I’m sick of looking at the same streets within a 4-5 mile radius of my house. I don’t have a bike and don’t really want one - traffic is nuts and I want to be able to take any mode of transport I’m using on a crowded subway with me when the city opens back up.

Skateboarding seems like it would fit the bill, and looks like fun - am I right about that? I don’t need to do anything fancy, just get around a little quicker than I do on foot and get some exercise in the meantime. Where do I start?

EDIT: Wow, thanks everyone! This is incredibly helpful and I’ve already learned a ton.

Some additional info that keeps coming up: 

I have zero interest in going fast or doing tricks, I just want a slightly quicker way to get around, and to learn a new skill and get some exercise in the meantime. I’ve never liked biking and wouldn’t have a place to keep a bike anyway (we live in a one bedroom apartment, and it’s already full) and though I’ve been pretty into inline skating in the past, I don’t have skates at the moment and I’d like to try something different.

I’m 5’2”, 115 lbs, with short legs. I’m a gnome. I walk long distances all the time and go running sometimes, so I’m in decent shape, but not, you know, super athletic or anything.

I live in a busy neighborhood in NYC and I’m beginning to think maybe a longboard isn’t the best option for that reason. Even our parks are crowded compared to other places. 

It would also be handy if whatever I end up with didn’t look too much like something that would be fun to steal. 

I will definitely get protective gear! I know I’ll fall down but I don’t want to be stupid about it either.

StopCovid est encore pour l'instant en rodage. Il n'y a même pas eu de campagne pour promouvoir son usage. Mais lorsque le système sera suffisamment testé, son usage s'imposera assez naturellement:

Pour permettre que les salles de spectacles, stades, lieux publics rouvrent et attirent le public, les gérants feront fleurir les panneaux ""pour entrer dans ce lieu, je me protège et j'active StopCovid"". Ils y verront leur intêret bien senti, et le public ira de préférence dans ces établissements plus responsables.

Les porteurs de chapeaux en aluminium sont très utiles pour maintenir l'attention sur le sujet, et faire de l'utilisation de cette application un acte citoyen, un peu comme le port du masque dans les magasins et les transports publics. 

Parce que rendre son utilisation volontaire plutôt qu'obligatoire est un acte responsabilisant, qui génère plus d'engagement chez ses utilisateurs, et permet donc qu'elle soit mieux utilisée, et donc plus efficace.

The first thing I'm getting when non-essential e-commerce is allowed is to buy proper headphones that makes my voice clearer or at least audible.

The headphones in terms of audio are better than the 700 and the qc35ii from Bose although it kind of depends on what kind of sound you prefer. I also do have a Jabra given to me by the company and it definitely is better in terms of call clarity but bad everywhere else. However it costs 5k and I personally wouldn't by a pair of headphones worth 5k just for a conference call.


Edit - what I mean is if you have the budget and you want to get a bang on pair of headphones which you can also use for calls you can go for the sony wh1000xm3. I haven't used the bose ones for calls. If you want the best possible conference call quality and nothing else then a 5-7k Jabra would suffice. Honestly I don't think it really matters.

I read lots of complains about Zerodha so I went with Upstox. But OMG they are god awful, very unprofessional and amateurish everything. No support except for twitter, degraded website. NEST trader is featureless. They are selling themselves in the name of Ratan Tata. I have read same kind of stories with Zerodha,5 Paisa etc when it comes to their system and service. I also have a/c with Kotak securities and they are 100 times better BUT charges are VERY high compared to any discount broker, any daily trader can't trader with them. 

So anyone here with experience in the field pls suggest a good, professional and low brokerage service. Thanks.",1591966861.0,"Depends on what kind of trading do you do...

Outages and problems can happen at any broker or even exchange level (eg recent NSE BANKNIFTY fiasco). They cannot be protected against.

If you are a long term investor willing to research a lot before investing, then go for a discount broker with a good GUI - in that case continuing with zerodha is a good idea.

If you are looking to do intraday price action trading then a discount trader essentially becomes a necessity. Also intraday leverages also become important. So options like zerodha, 5paisa (they claim to be the second largest discount brokers), upstox, angelbroking and regional like alice blue etc are there. 

Others like Indiabulls, IIFL are also there but ?how good

If you are trading in the F&O segment then zerodha is highly restrictive for the most commonly traded options as they breach the 15%/500 crore rule for market wide limit quite often. Only way around that is to go to smaller discount brokers irrespective of how good they are. "

Now when I check whether due amount is gone, it's still there but now the amount I paid shows up as debit.  There is also an option to convert my due into a loan.

### Tl;dr

Resident Welfare Associations ('RWAs') have nominated themselves as the first line of defence against the coronavirus pandemic. Media reports suggest that RWAs are going well beyond the guidelines issued by the government and mandating use of Aarogya Setu by residents and visitors including domestic workers, drivers, delivery personnel and other service providers. Such measures may be well intentioned but they are illegal because the bottom line is that RWAs are private self-administration bodies which lack the power to issue rules restricting the freedom of movement and right to livelihood of individuals. In lights of this, we wrote to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the National Real Estate Development Council and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare seeking issuance of an advisory which clarifies that use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app cannot be made a precondition for entering residential colonies.

### Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it is RWAman!

&#x200B;

[Credit: https:\/\/twitter.com\/penpencildraw ](https://preview.redd.it/m3ig46jtla251.jpg?width=606&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e31445c0a7eb66f6707ee84e29a7be6de93957d8)

Media reports indicate that Resident Welfare Associations (‘RWAs’) in several cities have made use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app a precondition for residents and visitors such as domestic workers, drivers, delivery persons, service providers etc. As you may know, Aarogya Setu is a COVID-19 surveillance app launched by the Indian government which has been heavily criticized for privacy, security and exclusion related concerns.  IFF has opposed mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on the[ **litigation**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/),[ **policy**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-studied-the-protocol-and-no-this-doesnt-sufficiently-protect-your-privacy/),[ **RTI**](https://internetfreedom.in/aarogya-setu-through-the-right-to-information-lens/) and[ **public advocacy**](https://internetfreedom.in/45-organizations-and-105-prominent-individuals-push-back-against-the-coercion-of-aarogya-setu/)fronts. But before we delve into the legality of rules made by RWAs which mandate use of Aarogya Setu, let us first understand what is the legal status of RWAs themselves. 

A Resident Welfare Association is a voluntary body formed by the residents for the residents. It is a self-financed and self- managed association registered under the Society Registration Act, 1860 (subject to state-level amendments). The primary purpose of such an association is to represent the interests of residents of a specific locality/complex and perform the following illustrative functions:

* Represent the residents before the governmental authorities;
* Collect money for maintenance of common areas;
* Establish good public infrastructure for the residents;
* Organize workshops and cultural functions etc.

The government may also issue guidelines to RWAs as seen in the context of the [**Bhagidari Scheme**](http://www.rwabhagidari.com/registerRWA.htm) in Delhi, which aims to promote broad-based civic participation in local governance. The formation of an RWA has also been made mandatory under Section 19(9) of the Real estate (Regulations & Development) Act, 2016.

RWAs are governed by their Memorandum of Association (MoA)/ by laws which contain their objectives and functions. While the by-laws are binding amongst the residents, they lack statutory character and do not have the force of law as [**clarified**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1900075/) by the Bombay High Court. For similar reasons, RWAs cannot issue directions prohibiting residents from keeping pet animals in violation of [**guidelines**](http://www.awbi.org/awbi-pdf/pet_dog_circular_26_2_2015.pdf) issued by the Animal Welfare Board of India under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

### RWAs turn mini-sovereigns during COVID 19

The role of RWAs during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial to ensure that residents and visitors are adhering to government guidelines relating to wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in common areas. RWAs are also responsible for maintaining sanitation of common areas and facilitating supply of essential commodities in their locality. Recognizing the importance of RWAs as stakeholders, the National Centre for Disease Control has issued an [**advisory for RWAs**](https://ncdc.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/3931246121585916767.pdf) to support and complement governmental efforts to contain spread of the virus. 

However, RWAs are slowly morphing from private self-administration bodies to mini-sovereigns in their own right. Several RWAs have taken it upon themselves to impose restrictions which as this [**news report**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/lockdown-is-easing-but-many-rwas-seem-not-to-have-noticed/) notes, *‘‘make even the stringent terms of the lockdown pale in comparison.”* For example, an RWA in [**Gurugram**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/gurugram-rwa-insists-on-covid-report/articleshow/75837887.cms) has asked its residents to have their domestic help tested for COVID-19 before they can be allowed into the premises. This is clearly inconsistent with testing guidelines framed by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) - the only competent authority for frame guidelines for COVID-19 testing. In another instance in [**Noida**](https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/apr/24/denied-medicine-for-parents-claims-noida-man-as-society-seeks-aarogya-setu-2134781.html), permission to enter a housing complex will be granted only if the entrant has a ‘green’ status on the Aarogya Setu app.  


The most recent [**order**](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/MHAOrderDt_30052020.pdf) issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on 30 May 2020 states that use of Aarogya Setu should be encouraged by employers on a “best efforts” basis and district authorities may “advise” individuals to install the app. The terminology used in these guidelines makes it abundantly clear that RWAs have not been authorized by the government to mandate use of Aarogya Setu among residents and visitors, and they do not have any authority to prohibit entry to residential colonies on this ground.  


As we have explained earlier, COVID-19 surveillance apps are susceptible to false positives and false negatives because of inherent limitations of bluetooth technology which is not a perfect proxy for virus exposure. If RWAs were allowed to force residents and visitors to download the Aarogya Setu app and allow entry based on the status displayed on the app, it could lead to wrongful confinement of certain residents and deprivation of livelihood of working class service providers. Residents who are shown by the app to be at risk of COVID-19 could be prohibited from leaving their house or accessing common areas. Further, domestic workers, drivers, delivery persons and other service providers could also be prohibited from entering the colony to do their jobs based on their status on the app.

### What can an ordinary resident do?

If you find yourself in a situation with an overzealous RWA, first ask them for a copy of the by-laws and the rules and details of the procedure by which they were adopted. The RWA’s MoA and by-laws will contain the procedure for amending existing rules or adding new rules. Generally, new rules or amendments cannot be made without a General Body Meeting. If the rule making procedure has been flouted, the rules will be invalid.

We also encourage you to have a constructive dialogue with your RWA representatives highlighting concerns about accuracy and privacy of the Aarogya Setu app and explain that official MHA guidelines do not authorize RWAs to require mandatory use of Aarogya Setu. Any rules which are inconsistent with governmental guidelines may be an abuse of power by the RWA and can be challenged in court. Any resident who is aggrieved by  arbitrary and unreasonable actions of an RWA can file a suit under Section 6 of the Societies Registration Act, 1860. The RWA can be sued in the local civil court in the name of the President or Secretary.

### Representation to Government

We recognize that individual residents and working class service providers may not always have the bargaining power to negotiate with RWAs or approach courts. Therefore, we have written to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the National Real Estate Development Council and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare seeking issuance of an advisory which clarifies that use of the Aarogya Setu mobile app cannot be made a precondition for entering residential colonies.

As researchers at the Centre for Internet and Society note in their [**recent article**](https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/essay-watching-corona-or-neighbours-introducing-2018lateral-surveillance2019-during-covid201919) on lateral surveillance, the COVID-19 pandemic has witnessed an increase in surveillance by private actors. Residential colonies cannot be controlled by RWAs as mini-sovereigns, and insofar as RWAs impose measures which are inconsistent with guidelines issued by the government, it amounts to vigilantism. During the COVID-19 crisis, the need of the hour is social solidarity and the government has a positive duty to prevent RWAs from engaging in intrusive and arbitrary practices which lack any basis in law and promote a culture of suspicion, stigma and exclusion.

If you like the subject ,please dont join a college based on their rankings or based on merit.

***Try finding out about the labs and faculty and join based on it.***

Why:

Every Engineering field requires good mentors and people experienced in this field but one advantage  for something like CS is that you dont need to rely on colleges for your practical knowledge(programming).

I would say that labs in EC are the most crucial part and it will decide on how employable you are.Most colleges in the country have the worst labs and teaching staff who have no knowledge in circuit design(throwing large theories without  explaining why the circuit works is  only useful for academics).Why would anyone want to hire someone without any sort of practical understanding and knowledge(but i guess i know how to do fft and draw a butterfly diagram).You cannot get the practical knowledge from a online course ,a mentor is necessary.

&#x200B;

Present Situation:

Our internship and placement drives are starting soon and everyone is in a coding bootcamp/course and it is sad that after learning all these complex concepts we are not employable.The worst moment was when one of our faculty told us to learn programming and it was okay to get a software job.Then why study all these concept? Why learn all this to end up as a tier 2 CS engineer?

&#x200B;

What can you do about it?

I am sure there many people who have gotten into EC and have regrets but it is not all dark and gloomy.

I study in one of the top university in the state and have a good gpa but it wont land you a job.Our syllabus is only for academic purposes and doesnt set you up for anything.The best option you have is to get into embedded systems  ,the digital circuit design background with c programming can help you get into in this field.I am not talking programming an arduino(its not meant for professional use /product development).Try something like PIC from microchip,ARM 32 micro controller (your EC background will be useful).ES is a field which you can learn from online courses and go a long way.The best part is that you dont need try learning a whole list of languages.Pretty much all micro controllers use C ( learn c++ eventually and python is always good for creating useful scripts).

Embedded systems is a field that will never stop growing and will  always need engineers to write the firmware.Our background in Electronics is a huge plus and it is a field most computer science engineers look away.YES ,this is also a software job but at-least you dont waste 4 years for nothing.

&#x200B;

Just a small rant and advice to EC under-grads.

EDIT: I wanted to add that ,doing software job is fine if you enjoy it and  your  graduation degree  doesnt matter.  We all have our passions  but at the end of the day money is also important,only reason software companies hire EC students is because we are cheaply available and they know that most of us are desperate for a job straight out of university,",1591491440.0,Isn't this common sense?

Here comes the weirdest part, i started asking my sister if she knew anything about them and as soon as she jokingly mentions that i might be hacked, we hear a loud high pitched notification from my phone. There was no notification popup on my phone and i don't even have that sound available on my phone, so it makes no sense that I would hear it. Naturally, i freak out and google the number that i received the otp from but no luck. I checked all the logged email accounts on the device and their device history, but i find nothing.

> 
> That makes it all the more bitterly ironic that the United States, with the largest number of coronavirus cases in the world, is now consciously spreading the pandemic beyond its borders by continuing to deport thousands of immigrants, many infected with the coronavirus, to poor countries ill equipped to cope with the disease.
> 
> President Trump and his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, have long shown themselves impervious to criticism of the effectiveness and morality of their hard-line policies. Yet in this pandemic, mass deportations are not only cruel but also dangerous to public health abroad and at home. Dangerous because seeding and fanning the pandemic in any country, let alone those suffering from corruption and poverty, will only prolong the health crisis and worsen the conditions that led to mass migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, Colombia, Honduras, Haiti and Mexico.
> 
> It’s happened before. In the 1990s, the Clinton administration signed legislation that made it easier to deport gang members from California to El Salvador, where they became the progenitor of violent gangs that spread through the region, sending tens of thousands of their victims to seek refuge in the United States. One of the gangs, MS-13, is often cited by President Trump as an example of the risk of letting in immigrants, legal or otherwise.
> 
> Guatemala offers an illustration of the problem today. In late April, its government reported that nearly a fifth of the country’s coronavirus cases were linked to deportees from the United States. On one flight of what is known as ICE Air, the deportation fleet run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 71 of 76 deportees tested positive for the coronavirus. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention went to Guatemala to check on the claim, 12 deportees selected at random all tested positive.
> 
> The Guatemalan government temporarily suspended accepting deportation flights, prompting Mr. Trump to threaten penalties against countries that “denied” or “delayed” accepting deportees. The flights are operating. Returning migrants, meanwhile, have become pariahs, subjected to threats and violence as the “contagiados,” the infected. Similar accounts have come from other countries receiving the expelled migrants. The United States, said the health minister of Guatemala, has become the “Wuhan of the Americas.”
> 
> Though deportations are down from the 23,103 that ICE reported in January, probably as a result of fewer arrivals through the closed border, they are continuing: 18,811 in March; 9,832 in April; 7,411 in May; and 2,221 in the first 13 days of June, according to figures provided by ICE. The agency said that since April 26 it has been testing “some aliens in custody and prior to removal.” But ICE said it was getting only about 2,000 tests per month from the Department of Health and Human Services, and so could test only a “sample” of the population. ICE is believed to have about 32,000 immigrants in detention centers across the United States in facilities where the virus can easily spread.
> 
> The responsible, not to mention humane, response when the pandemic struck would have been to suspend deportations — and to release as many immigrants as possible from detention centers that, like prisons across the United States, have become incubators of the pandemic. That is what Democratic lawmakers, human rights organizations and the United Nations urged, and what the countries to which infected migrants were being sent hoped for. Most European countries have put deportations on hold.
> 
> Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter in April accusing the Department of Homeland Security of “exploiting” the pandemic “by claiming new, sweeping powers to summarily expel large, unknown numbers of individuals arriving at our border in clear contravention of existing federal laws.” The U.N. Network on Migration, which includes the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the U.N. refugee agency, called on all governments on May 13 to suspend “forced returns” during the pandemic, arguing that deportations create serious health risks for everyone — “migrants, public officials, health workers, social workers and both host and origin communities.” The nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch also called for a moratorium on deportations, as well as a halt to involuntary transfers of migrants between facilities.
> 
> But there has been no grounding of ICE Air flights. Dozens of deportation flights have continued monthly, with destinations in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Brazil, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Jamaica, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which tracks ICE Air flights through public records. Unaccompanied youths have become a special target for fast-track deportations. Last week, a federal judge in Washington temporarily blocked the deportation of a 16-year-old Honduran with a stern reprimand to the government for its overly broad use of health laws to pursue its restrictionist immigration agenda.
> 
> At a closed meeting of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on April 17, the acting ICE director, Matthew T. Albence, explained that a broad release would signal that the United States was not enforcing its immigration laws, which would create a “huge pull factor” and cause a “rush at the borders.”
> 
> That show-no-mercy logic will not bow to common sense. That makes it all the more imperative for Congress, the courts and nongovernmental organizations to continue seeking an end to the administration’s dangerous deportation drive, and to expose its immigration policies for the assault on American values that they represent.

The best anyone will do is create a system produce more of skilled workers, which may be good for economy. It will keep people happy, because they will have jobs.

The concept of UPS is to give you enough time to turn off your computer. I'd suggest either moving to a laptop as they come in all shapes and sizes along required performance. Or, you should get yourself a 300VA inverter along with a 70amp battery at a cost under <10k. The battery is easily replaceable, you can refill it with water and they usually have 2-3 year warranty.

The latest numbers on unemployment claims came out this morning: [2.4 million workers filed for unemployment last week](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/21/unemployment-claims-numbers-coronavirus-272868), which means 38.6 million Americans – about 23.4% of the workforce – have lost their jobs over the last 9 weeks as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the economy.

(For some context, in normal times, the number of weekly unemployment claims usually hover around a couple hundred thousand.)

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last weekend that [U.S. unemployment could reach a Depression-level 25%](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/17/powell-unemployment-depression-25-percent-264500). Thousands of small businesses are closed and many will remain shut for good after losing all their revenue. The stock market bottomed out in March but has recovered somewhat since then and is now down about 15% from its pre-virus high point.

What officials are trying to do to save the economy:

* Congress has raced to pass multiple rescue bills totalling around $3 trillion in federal support, but they probably still need to send more aid to state and local governments and extend extra jobless benefits.
* The Trump administration is pushing for a swift economic re-opening, but is mostly leaving the official decision-making up to the states.
* The Fed has taken extraordinary measures to rescue the economy – slashing interest rates to zero, rolling out trillions of dollars in lending programs for financial markets and taking the unprecedented step of bailing out state and city governments.

So what does this mean for the future of the U.S. economy? How will we recover and get people back to work while staying safe and healthy? Ask us anything about the current economy amid the Covid-19 crisis and what lawmakers, the Fed, the Trump administration and other groups are trying to do about it.

**About us:**

[**Ben White**](https://twitter.com/morningmoneyben) is our chief economic correspondent and author of our “Morning Money” newsletter covering the nexus of finance and public policy. He’s been covering the [rapid economic decline](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/08/when-will-jobs-return-243925) and what [might happen in the near future](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/recession-odepression-america-reopening-scenarios-252984). Prior to joining Politico in 2009, Ben was a Wall Street reporter for the New York Times, where he shared a Society of Business Editors and Writers award for breaking news coverage of the financial crisis. Before that, he covered Wall Street for the Financial Times and the Washington Post.

In his limited free time, Ben loves to read history and fiction and watch his alter-ego Larry David on Curb Your Enthusiasm.

[**Austan Goolsbee**](https://twitter.com/Austan_Goolsbee) is an economist and current economics professor at the University of Chicago. He previously served as the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama and was a member of the cabinet. He is a past Fulbright scholar and Alfred P. Sloan fellow and served as a member of the Chicago Board of Education and the Economic Advisory Panel to the Congressional Budget Office. He currently serves on the Economic Advisory Panel to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Austan also writes the Economic View column for the New York Times and is an economic consultant to ABC News.

[**Victoria Guida**](https://twitter.com/vtg2) is a financial services reporter who covers banking regulations and monetary policy. She’s been covering the alphabet soup of [Fed emergency lending programs](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/09/federal-reserve-coronavirus-relief-176808) pouring trillions of dollars into the economy and [explaining how they're supposed to work](https://twitter.com/vtg2/status/1248630242803056640). In addition to covering the Federal Reserve, she also reports on the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Treasury. She previously spent years on the international trade beat.

During the precious few hours she spends not buried in finance and the economy, she’d like to say she’s read a lot of good books, but instead she’s been watching a lot of stress-free TV.

[**Nancy Cook**](https://twitter.com/nancook) covers the White House. Working alongside our robust health care team, she’s broken news on the White House’s moves to sideline its health secretary, its attempt to shift blame for the coronavirus response to the states and the ongoing plans to restart parts of the U.S. economy. Usually she writes about the White House’s political challenges, its personnel battles and its domestic policy moves on the economy, taxes, trade, immigration and health care.

Before joining the White House beat, Nancy covered health care policy and the Trump presidential transition for us. Before Politico, Nancy focused on economic policy, tax and business at Newsweek, National Journal and Fast Company.

In her very limited free time, she enjoys trying new recipes, reading novels and hanging out with her family.

A medical scientist researching Infectious Disease, for the US Government in Houston who was my classmates in college.

And our friendships are equally deep after his departure to America.

Got a call from him.

His first sentence was,

""Devendra Ji,

* Our PM Modi is some great man, probably.

I said

""Hey, he is, but what did he do now?""

He said, ""We have been doing research in India for the last 30 years on Infectious Disease, but this idea of 1 day curfew never came to our mind.""

I asked, ""Are you also making fun of Modi like seculars, leftists, Muslims, Thukde Thukde Gang, Urban Naxalites, Award Returning Gangs, AAP, NDTV etc in India?""

He said, ""Oh nothing like that, I and my whole family have been citizens of America for 19 years, My annual salary is more than 15 crores in Indian rupees, But the hearts are still Indian.

Every major step and decision of Modi is completely separated from politics, I wish the welfare of India and human beings I also saw Lakhs of Indians are making fun of Modi's 1 day self-imposed curfew, But in our laboratory, a 45-minute official meeting of all the big scientists has just been convened to discuss this announcement of Modi.

You would be surprised, this 45-minute meeting lasted for more than 3 hours, with a 1-day self-imposed curfew to discuss contagious diseases and its impact on Covid 19 in particular,

All scientists were of the opinion that, 12 hours is a very effective way to prevent the spread of corona virus by cutting every person from the world, Because Covid cannot survive for more than 12 hours on any surface outside the human body.

In such a situation, being cut off from the outside world, inanimate objects such as door handles, Currency notes, files, courier parcels, Steering wheels of vehicles Viruses on pens etc. will be completely eliminated, And without spending a single penny in this manner as suggested by Modi, Since there is no loss of work due to Sunday,

* The country will be almost free from viruses! * These ideas were not thought of in the minds of the world's highest level scientists of this subject

If any of his advisors has given this advice to Modi then this person is entitled to the Nobel Prize, and if the great idea is the brainchild of Modi, then he should get the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his contribution in the medical field of Infectious Disease. ""*

I could not even speak a word.

Here, crores of people of my country are making fun of Modi, Humiliating him as illiterate,

I am very frustrated with MagicBricks. This is a throwaway account.

I desperately needed money so I decided the best way would be to sell my shop through MagicBricks.

I bought their super titanium package for 13650 Rs on 18th March Evening. (Before lockdown)  

https://preview.redd.it/84599e4dvru41.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c78b5e1b42171a683dda9a44e41276cb8f46970

&#x200B;

Now, I never received their services. The ad never went live. The photoshoot and other services were never received due to lockdown. I am also not able to visit the shop due to lockdown. Interested buyers also won't be able to visit the shop due to lockdown.  


So I asked for a refund by calling them. They created a support ticket and this is the email I received.

https://preview.redd.it/ofcudzvavru41.jpg?width=1586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0870d803967eb4ba8ec4924478d34ed96651236

  
They say the ad was on hold as per my confirmation. Without photoshoot, content writing, how is the ad suppose to go live?  On the other hand, they say they are now going to run the advertisement/services by the end of the day.  
No interested buyer would be able to visit the shop till lockdown. I replied to their ticket.  


https://preview.redd.it/91926q1ovru41.jpg?width=1573&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0cf7b99d681d2a7e20faa34ea24de9a29812c2b

I replied to them that I want a refund, and this is their reply.

They are now claiming that I have utilized their services, which I obviously haven't and couldn't! They now have enabled services. Without any good photos on the ad, there will be hardly any interested buyers Plus no interested buyers will be able to visit my shop due to lockdown. 

I am forced to delay my plan to sell the shop for a few months.  

I do not have much money left with me. It would take a few months for the shop to be sold. I am a small failed businessman, the banks & other entities won't lend me personal loans or any other loan without collateral. I feel I don't have any option anymore other than getting a loan on collateral.

Since I need money urgently, I cannot afford to wait for months. I have to cancel my plan to sell the shop and get a loan on collateral.  


Running ads at this time would be a total waste of money for me.  


If they provided their services earlier and failed, I'd still understand. However, They haven't provided me service and won't refund me. And now after over a month, when I asked about refund, they are going to run ads during the lockdown.

They are going to run ads in their ghost town.  What can I do? Advice?",1587768215.0,"India is not USA and thats a **good** thing because our Consumer court system actually works.

I understood why these terms were laid when I got this plan years ago as laying lines and connecting whole city of Hyderabad isn't cheap.  


But come on guys, it's 2020! and they still impose FUP limits? even if they impose the limit, the speed after the limit is 512 kbps? seriously? I looked up at their product ""Flexibyte"" which gives additional data on top of FUP limit and 20 gigs cost  **₹**145.

As soon as I could I headed over. First things first, I took a walk touring the areas, equipment, and upstairs cardio deck which has a smaller, secluded room with a basic sets of equipment, and not many people in it. Didn’t think much of it, maybe a place for shyer guests to go?🤷🏽‍♂️ Anyway, with how busy it’s been most of the stuff is in use equating to a lot of waiting around, but oh I got it! Easy solution, I’ll use that room! Yeah perfect, not packed, it’s got the basic stuff I need, in and out quick, nice. I should note I don’t look around much, no one wants to be stared at working out and we’re all there for ourselves so I try to fall into a zone and do my thing. Well after 2 weeks of freely using that room this time I noticed 2 things, now that I think about it Ive only seen women in here, and also, the fact that the room immediately CLEARED out when I came in today. Suddenly other things I had noticed over the last 2 weeks popped into mind, heads turning toward me in my peripheral whenever I walked in and out, subtle looks of surprised the few times I met eyes with people in there... and like a conspiracy theorist bedroom wall with pictures connected by red string the pieces came together, years of watching CSI helping to deduce. Quick feeing of anxious panic I put the dumbbells down and speed walk outside the room, but not without meeting the surprised expression of a girl walking in, further confirming what I believed. I looked to the left side for a women’s only sign, nothing, on the wall walking in, nothing, look overhead the room, nothing, then .. the right of the room.. in big metal letters, W.O.W. - women’s only workout. Oh. My. God. Realizing where this tank topped frat boy looking douche had been slinging weights the last two weeks I quickly went back to grab my shite and re rack. The only girl left in there being very nice as she must’ve noticed the mortified look on my face and just laughed as I apologized quickly. I speed walk outta the gym with my gaze low hella embarrassed. And cherry on top of the shite cake, walking out the doors I look ahead and where I thought I parked behind someone, I was parked in the between the two sets of parking lanes dead centre in the middle of the road, right in front of the front doors, blocking traffic for the last 45 mins. Groups of people walking in watching my douchey looking ass get in my asshole park job and drive off... so I guess all that to say, if you’re one of the ladies in Brighton’s women only room very sorry for creeping you out.. Very embarrassed.. and to Brighton motion fit, see ya, barely new ya, my face isn’t coming around anytime soon.",1592571241.0,That’s one long paragraph.

If it had sold at Rs 310, govt could have got Rs 30,000 crore from the deal. Now it stands to get only around Rs 15,800 crore.


Axis Bank 52 week high was Rs 827. Now it is Rs383. Govt selling its full stake of 4.69%.

If it had sold at Rs 827, govt could have got Rs 10,700 crore from the deal. Now it stands to get only around Rs 4900 crore.

Totally, govt is losing out on 20,000 crores. 

This shows how incompetent this govt is at managing its own finances. Its true that COVID crisis has brought about huge financial strain.

Thus the country and its citizens are losing out on 20,000 crores.

1258,Some insight into manufacturing electronics in India - Discussions with a friend from Taiwan,30,hc2x78,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/hc2x78/some_insight_into_manufacturing_electronics_in/,False,5,Policy/Economy,"So I have a discord buddy from Taiwan and recently we were talking about the Indo-China border clash and we had a very long discussion. I believe these insights are relevant because (i)  My friend's dad works in electronics and (ii) My friend constantly fights with their parents over politics.

**Some background**

&#x200B;

1. Almost all modern electronics manufacturing is dominated by Taiwanese companies. They are the sleeping giants in a sense (unlike Koreans and Japanese who are well known). Taiwan has a massive ecosystem of contract manufacturers and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs). Name almost any major electronic product and it comes from a Taiwanese company - Phones? (Foxconn, FIH, Wistron, Pegatron), Laptops? (Compal, Quanta, Wistron, Pegatron), Laptop Chargers? (Delta, LiteOn, Chicony Power), Motherboards? (Asus,MSI,Gigabyte). Even gaming consoles are manufactured by Foxconn, Inventec and Pegatron.  Where the Taiwanese lack relative expertise are in the industries of the future where China is leading today (electric cars, solar cells, batteries). Companies from Taiwan don't really market many products under their own brand, but they provide essential B2B manufacturing and design services that makes the global electronics supply chain tick.
2. Long story short - the Taiwanese have the know-how to manufacture EVERYTHING and they are largely responsible for enabling China's rise in electronics manufacturing.  But Taiwan and China are mortal enemies right? So how did this happen you ask?
3. Since 1992 - China and Taiwan have operated on what is called the '1992 Consensus' - back then the ruling party in Taiwan was the Kuomintang (erstwhile rules of present day China, before the Communists took over). The Kuomintang has always considered Taiwan to be 'Chinese' and they were keen to foster economic ties with the mainland.
4. Starting in the early 90s and accelerating once China joined the WTO, Taiwanese companies invested billions of dollars into China building factories and training manpower. Taiwan and China share what is essentially the same culture and the same spoken language (particularly the older generation), however written form is slightly different (Simplified in China v. Traditional in Taiwan).
5. As manufacturing in China rapidly grew in the mid to late 90s, ties between big business  and the Kuomintang grew cozier. Manufacturing jobs moved to China hollowing out the middle class leading to higher income inequality in Taiwan.
6. Kuomintang lost power in early 2000s to the opposition (and current ruling party) DPP. However, investment continued to pour and factories continued to be built. Governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait recognized the importance of maintaining economic ties. The President of Taiwan at that time Chen Shui-bian proclaimed what came to be known as the [Four Noes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noes_and_One_Without), essentially continuing the system that existed during the preceding Government. This was done under pressure from big business in Taiwan, since China had recently joined the WTO and the real opportunity to mint big bucks had arrived. The CCP and (more importantly) provincial governments of China showered huge subsidies and incentives to facilitate manufacturing by the Taiwanese ODMs (who they considered to be their compatriots).
7. The DPP government ruled for 8 years, before being replaced by Koumintang for 4 more years. It was not till the election of the current government under Tsai Ing Wen of the DPP in 2016 was there any actual effort taken to 'de-couple' from China.
8. Even today, there is a lot of pressure from big business to continue good ties with China - My friend had an argument with dad where dad apparently said 'You should be glad for the existence of the PRC, that is why you have a roof on your head'
9. The situation in Taiwan is like most other countries - The young are fed up with a system that works for a few rich people and serves Corporate interests that are beholden to cheap Chinese manufacturing.  The current generation grew up at a time when Taiwan became a democracy (sometime in the 80s) and they feel the threat of their cross-straits neighbor. This is the reason for Tsai-Ing-Wen's landslide win this year. However, my friend is a critic of her and says that she has not taken enough steps to de-couple the island's economy from China. She is more into rhetoric than taking actual steps, although Taiwanese are now waiting to see what she does on HK.
10. The current generation of Taiwanese pretty much hate the CCP and think of themselves as 'Taiwanese' and not 'Chinese. In fact, even the linguistic ties as slowly fraying and the language is evolving in unique ways among the Taiwanese youth, My friend told me that their generation is much better at catching fake news articles planted on social media since they use a distinctly mainland language, but the 'boomers' in Taiwan don't seem to get this because they speak a very 'mainland' like tongue.

**What does this mean for India?**

1. Currently, most Taiwanese ODMs have little to zero interest in manufacturing in India. The few units that exist here, do so purely for domestic sales and for export to regional markets. Pegatron and Foxconn have factories - but high end phones continue to be imported.  ODMs have developed cozy relationships with CCP officials and they donate generously to Kuomintang to ensure that they have enough political influence to do business with China. In the words of my friend ' They have sold Taiwan to China for profits'
2. The fear among ODMs is (1) the enormous investment required to de-couple from China and (2) the lack of sufficient government incentives to pay for that de-coupling and (iii) the impact that de-coupling with have on their relationships with local and provincial CCP officials who actually provide the support necessary.
3. The only thing that could possibly bring some manufacturing to India and force the ODMs to move is GLOBAL tariffs on Chinese products. This appears to be growing increasingly possible with the [recent loss of a landmark WTO case by China](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/06/16/world/china-loses-landmark-wto-dispute-eu/), which could allow a lot of countries to legally put anti-dumping duties on China.
4. If a younger generation of executives takes over at the ODMs, we could see the migration happen, but this is uncertain at best because most ODMs continue to be family owned and they will prioritize their business above all.

In North America you can send your device back to Nintendo and they will fix the issue for you for free.  However, India doesn't have an official Nintendo presence so there is no warranty.

Accordingly if you get a switch and the problem occurs, you can just buy a new pair of joycons and save your investment. However if you have a switch lite, there's nothing you can do since the joy cons on the switch lite are not removable. "

 If you have been following the news for the past 6 months, this news wont come as shocking to you . There is a term in political science to what you are experiencing. Its called the Overton window.

The Overton window is a political theory that refers to the range (or window) of policies and ideas that the public will accept.
The idea is that any policy falling outside the Overton window is radical, ridiculous and unthinkable. And everything inside it is normal and expected.

So, When you want to force people to accept a radical and ridiculous idea, you start with the most extreme and ludicrous ideas. So forcing people to consider an unthinkable and clearly ludicrous idea, makes all the 'less radical' and 'lesser ridiculous' policies or ideas acceptable by comparison. It shifts the Overton window in that particular direction.

So if you want to make people more accepting of the attacks against a minority for a Machiavellian strategy like divide and rule to work out, you start by introducing an extremely ridiculous policy. You'll lose at first but you'll start to make things like the Mob Violence look more plausible.And Then hate groups and associations seems to look normal.
Pretty soon what started off as an unthinkable idea seems very thinkable.

The point i'm making is that people dont have to accept a particular radical policy, but just have to get used to it, eventually making it boring and seem normal .

That is the scariest thing about the current govt. The Overton window has now shifted in a very similar manner and now a Draconian law like the UAPA seem pretty much whats expected of the BJP govt. The most obvious part being that we are all expected to be accepting of such ridiculous ideas.

But what's even more scarier is whats happening at the 'Normal Side' of the Overton Window. The window has now shifted in such a way, that what was considered unthinkable a decade ago is now normal to all of us. It has arguably influenced how we perceive news. It doesn't shock us anymore.

**Tl;dr**

On May 11, 2020 the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) released the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 (“[**The Protocol**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Aarogya_Setu_data_access_knowledge_Protocol.pdf)”). It revealed the Government of India’s National Executive Committee (“NEC”) has constituted an Empowered Group on Technology and Data Management, which is looking at among other things the development and implementation of the Aarogya Setu. The Protocol is meant to allay concerns of informational privacy and mass surveillance which are attached with the Aarogya Setu programme. However, according to our clause by clause analysis it falls considerably short of principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.

We would like to thank IFF’s off-counsel Vrinda Bhandari; and lawyers Abhinav Sekhri and Gautam Bhatia in helping us unpack the Protocol.

**Background**

Multiple petitions have been filed before the Kerala High Court against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu. These petitions include one which is filed by Jackson Mathew, in which IFF is offering legal support. A day before hearings on May 11, 2020 the MeitY released the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 (“[**The Protocol**](https://meity.gov.in/writereaddata/files/Aarogya_Setu_data_access_knowledge_Protocol.pdf)”). As highlighted in our [**update yesterday**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/), about the hearings at the Kerala High Court, highlighted that the Counsel from MeitY insisted that Aarogya Setu was the best app in the world and emphasized that a protocol had also been issued to address privacy concerns. This argument was meant to suggest that the Protocol ring fences the Aarogya Setu app sufficient legal backing and also offers enough safeguards to people’s privacy.

Our analysis also comes in the wake of the Aarogya Setu app being made mandatory to access many essential services and facilities. For instance, in a late night [**tweet**](https://twitter.com/RailMinIndia/status/1259919781945319426), the Ministry of Railways announced that as passenger trains restart, it will be mandatory for passengers to download the app. Similarly, the Ministry of Civil Aviation has proposed a standard operating procedure (SOP) to restart commercial travel. [**The proposed SOP reportedly will require all flight passengers to have a “Green Status” on the Aarogya Setu app**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/post-lockdown-flights-civil-aviation-ministry-suggests-no-cabin-baggage-in-initial-phase-detailed-questionnaire-for-passengers/articleshow/75695955.cms).

&#x200B;

[Tweet by Ministry of Railways](https://preview.redd.it/sqm9pgvdrhy41.png?width=542&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0652ce4054fd89444efa81bebb1f796a7999f95)

However, as our analysis states (a PDF of which is provided at the end of this document) very clearly states that the Protocol fails to satisfy the **legality threshold**.

**Compatibility with Legality**

The Protocol is not a statute, and nor does it offer any legislative foundation for the Aarogya Setu Mobile Application. Therefore, the primary issue of Aarogya Setu lacking legal basis is still alive and unaddressed. For clarity fundamental rights under the Constitution cannot be restricted by the Government even for legitimate purposes without express legislative authorisation. The Protocol is not - and does not purport to provide - any such authorisation. A troubling aspect in this regard, is that Government authorities have said that there are no plans to create an underlying legislation to hold the usage of the app accountable, since the “[***priority at present is to deal with the epidemic itself***](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/no-plan-to-bring-in-law-to-regulate-aarogya-setu-at-this-point-secy-meity-120051000727_1.html)*.*”

**Underlying Basis and Rationale of the Order is Questionable**

Keeping this questionable legality in mind, we notice that the Government has constituted 11 Empowered Groups. **Empowered Group 9 is specifically tasked with Technology and Data Management**. It is important to note that to the best of our knowledge there is no mention in a press bulletin, Government notification, the Aarogya Setu app’s Terms of Service, Privacy Policy or FAQs, that Empowered Group 9 has been solely responsible for the creation and execution of the Aarogya Setu app.

There is also no reference in this Order or any other government notification about the actual membership composition of Empowered Group 9 on Technology and Data Management. **In addition, there is no reference in the Protocol or any other government notification about the means through which Empowered Group 9 has sought external inputs on the drafting of the Protocol**.

The Protocol is drafted in a manner, which justifies the centralised collection of data through the new Aarogya Setu platform. It does this without any discussion about the choice of design, and why existing alternatives which exist through avenues like telecom operators, or for that matter anonymised mobility reports reports developed in an open source format by researchers and organisations like Facebook/Google, are not enough. **There is no discussion on why existing data at the Government’s disposal collected through hospitals, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, on ground surveillance teams, etc. does not suffice in fulfilling the objective referenced by the Protocol.**

The Protocol also fails to acknowledge the fact that when data is collected in a primary fashion from individual users, it is of course a more intrusive collection process. Therefore it comes with inherent risks to informational privacy. Instead the Protocol stresses on the need for *efficient* data collection and sharing. Unfortunately, there is little to no discussion on ensuring that the most privacy-respecting practices are adopted, which are least intrusive in nature.

In addition the Protocol arbitrarily states that there is an urgent need for data pertaining to individuals “*to formulate appropriate health responses for addressing the Covid-19 pandemic*”. What is convenient for authorities is that “Appropriate health responses” **is expansively defined**. In fact such an expansive definition is curious since a think tank which supported the Government of India in drafting the Protocol has [**stated in an explainer blog post**](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/2020/05/11/aarogya-setus-data-access-and-knowledge-sharing-protocol-2020/) that the purpose of the Protocol is “*exposure notification and contact tracing”*. If that were indeed the case, then such a broad definition for Appropriate health responses is incompatible with the principle of *proportionality*.

In contrast, all other apps across the world’s democracies (across the economic and geographical spectrum) are only deploying apps to support/expedite their country’s on-ground contact tracing efforts. [**In India the app’s expansiveness is being positioned as it speaks to India’s innovation**](https://twitter.com/CNBCTV18News/status/1259878975729369091?s=09). This would be a disingenuous characterisation. Most other countries are taking their time to ensure that the application of such technologies when ultimately scaled are in fact consistent with their civil liberties obligations.

Therefore, the Protocol is not engaging in data collection through the prism of deploying the least restrictive measure that is hemmed in by clear purpose-based requirements, and is, therefore, falling foul of the proportionality principle.

**Concerns About Implementation and Possible Mission Creep**

The Protocol fails to specify how it will interact with the Aarogya Setu app’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that were already in place. For instance, the Privacy Policy already contains a set of practices governing data collection and storage. Many of those provisions are now in conflict with the Protocol. However, the Protocol fails to outline the effect of these conflicts and how they will be rationalised.  This creates confusion, uncertainty, and risks of greater flexibility for retention and sharing of people’s personal and sensitive personal information.

We also believe that the chain of command **evokes concerns of possible mission creep**. What is especially concerning is that India’s public health institutions have minimal leadership even as these technologies are being built to respond to a public health crisis.

**Don’t Just Use Buzzwords Like “Necessary and Proportionate”. Meaningfully Incorporate Them**

The use of such phraseology is meant to demonstrate that the Protocol incorporates *purpose* and *use* limitations on data collected by the App. However, they are far from *restrictive*. For example, “Appropriate health responses” is a broad term that covers a wide gamut of government operations. In other words, “purpose limitation” and the principles of necessity and proportionality with respect to data collection acts as a meaningful constraint only if the purpose is spelt out with clarity and specificity to start with. If the purpose itself is excessively broad, vague, and evolving, then “necessity” and “proportionality” have no meaning at all, since data collection needs to be necessary and proportionate with regard to the purpose for which it is being collected. The Protocol, therefore, attempts to do an end run around core data principles by leaving the purpose so vague and ill-defined, that excessive data collection can potentially always be justified as necessary and proportionate.

Further, the Protocol’s reference to the principle for processing data in a “*fair, transparent and non-discriminatory manner*” rings hollow. Specifically, it does not require the NIC to *publicly share* its data processing practises. **In fact, one way for processing to be transparent is by publishing the app’s underlying source code. Instead, India has not published the Aarogya Setu app’s source code and even now, a** [**recent statement of the Secretary, MeitY**](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/aarogya-setu-india-contact-tracing-app-10-crore/?tpcc=ECTW2020)**indicates a reticence to publish the source code before the public**.

**Excessive Collection, Processing and Storage of Personal Data**

According to the Protocol, the default setting is that contact and location data remain on the device and not uploaded on to the server. This default setting is, however, immediately overridden by the next sentence which states that such data **may be** uploaded to the server to formulate / implement appropriate health responses. Given the breadth of this purpose, there is, in effect, no clarity or certainty on when contact and location data may be uploaded on the server. Moreover, the breadth of this exemption allows for the seamless creation of a centralised system.

In general the storage policies are high deficient and cannot be aligned with people’s right to privacy, or the proportionality principle:

1. Data retention for six months, without any process of review while allowing for potential extension of this time-limit, is not the least intrusive measure that could be adopted. This is because it allows for retaining of people’s personal data for durations beyond the duration of the Protocol itself. Consider the following example. Imagine someone’s contact/location/self assessment data is exported on daya 45. Then that data could be retained for a period of 45 days beyond the purported last date of the Protocol which is fixed at 6 months where this data retention takes place in a legal vacuum.
2. The Protocol also fails to clarify what are the *extraordinary* circumstances in which the Government may unilaterally retain contact, location and self assessment data for a period longer than 180 days.
3. There is no policy for destroying contact, location and self assessment data based on a user request, contrary to the Protocol for demographic data. The total failure to consider user-request based destruction of such data amounts to retaining personal data without consent and is a clear breach of the right to privacy.
4. Para 5(e) also fails to clarify whether this provision applies to anonymised data or not. This is important to highlight because the current Privacy Policy of the Aarogya Setu App specifies that the data retention clause is not applicable to anonymised data. Such exemptions, if they still subsist, retain concerns of permanent systems of data analysis/surveillance.

**Researchers Can Get Access to Our Data. Wait? What?**

The Protocol allows for **sharing response data for research purposes** with certain specified institutions / entities registered in India where the data has undergone “Hard Anonymisation”. This demonstrates the incentives for why the Government of India has taken a centralised approach. It is less about taking the least intrusive measure towards responding to the public health crisis, but more towards maximising the utility of data. In some ways it also shows an appetite on the Government of India to commercialise or discover commercial applications the Aarogya Setu app, rather than go the path of other democratic societies which are more focused on decentralised models which may effectively alert people to get tested and treated for the coronavirus itself. That such opportunities would be non-existent in a decentralised model of data storage only further supports the argument that the adoption of a centralised model for the Aarogya Setu App is not driven by purposes related to containing the spread of Covid-19.  Additionally, it shows why the data retention limits of the Aarogya Setu programme do not apply to anonymised and aggregated datasets. Therefore, there is a greater need for public scrutiny on this front.

**The Sunset Clause Misses the Point**

The Sunset Clause (Para 10) fails to adequately address temporal restrictions on the gathering of data by the Aarogya Setu Mobile Application. In fact, the sunset clause potentially allows for gathering such data on even more relaxed terms and conditions. Moreover, the Sunset Clause allows for its extension without any independent institutional review.

Most importantly, the Sunset Clause is insufficient since there is no reference to the actual destruction of servers and systems created as an output of the Aarogya Setu programme. Without such a reference, a sunset clause is meaningless and evokes concerns of the creation of a permanent infrastructure of Government surveillance.

I was hoping the NAHL was somehow actually the AHL which is the 2nd best league after the NHL but nope, its an amateur league for  high school and college players with no future in hockey past D3 colleges basically (with some D1 players mixed in).   And they are considered ""Tier 2"" at junior hockey in the USA at that - the USHL is the one where the junior players may actually have a future in it past the age of 22.

 The Mavericks are significantly better connected and in a much better league with much better players.  They are actually minor league players connected to real NHL teams. "

India has registered a two-place drop to 132 on the Ookla's Speedtest Global Index for mobile broadband speeds in April. The average mobile broadband download speed in the country was 9.81Mbps during April while the average upload speed was registered to be 3.98Mbps for the same period. The drop in the mobile Internet speeds could be attributed to the massive surge in Internet usage in India due to the coronavirus lockdown. The latest ranking released by the global Internet speed tracker company shows India slipping even below Bangladesh among the neighbouring countries. India already ranks below Pakistan and Nepal in terms of mobile broadband speeds.

As per the [Speedtest Global Index](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index), the global average mobile broadband download speeds in April registered at 30.89Mbps while the global average upload speed was at 10.50Mbps. The list was topped by South Korea with an average mobile broadband download speed of 88.01Mbps and the last - 139th - position was held by Afghanistan (6.02Mbps). Other than South Korea, countries including Qatar, China, United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands held the top four spots.

Among the neighbours, Bangladesh is now at 130th place, after gaining two places, on the Index with an average mobile download speed of 9.96Mbps, whereas Pakistan was at 112th spot with an average mobile download speed of 14.34Mbps.

Ignoring the COVID-19 quarantine situation you are able to travel freely inside the Schengen area.

I'm an entertainment lighting specialist. Primarily I work as a lighting director operating consoles and putting up rigs for concerts, festivals, theatre etc. For the last 2ish years I've had steady work, primarily in touring family entertainment shows. Last year I made about 60k before taxes. Its my dream job, I'm good at it and I love it.

  
In March, my current tour, future tours, and plan B local gigs all vanished with the pandemic. I have booked one weekend gig for the foreseeable future, in the season I'm normally working 80 hours a week. I have robust savings because I've always known my job to be feast or famine, and government aid plus EI will keep me afloat for a good amount of time. However, I can't help but feel like the entertainment industry will take years to get even close to what it was. Shows that actually pay enough to be worthwhile need big audiences, big venues, and most notably, big insurance policies that currently no one is giving out. It's also extremely hard work. On tour I'll work an average of 100 hours a week, sometimes we'll do 14 show days in a row.   


I'm computer savvy, I have basic programming and networking knowledge, should I be going back to school for a basic CS/Networking diploma and get myself out of this? Pursue a trade maybe? I don't want to throw away a career I spent 6 years building but I can't just wait and see what happens while my savings ebb away.

These cities look pathetic infront of big cities of the developed west or newly industrialized east. Even cities like Manila, Jakarta or Bangkok are way better than Delhi or Mumbai.

Big cities are engines of growth and to become a developed nation we need to make our cities way better. We need to fake it before we make it. 

If the quality of life improves then our big cities will attract a lot more FDI, foreign tourists and international talents. Even it will decrease the exodus of desi talent to developed nations.

Here are some ideas of making our big cities better:-

A) Convertion of our six megacities into full city states. Those would be Delhi NCR, Greater Mumbai, Greater Kolkata, Greater Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.

B) Elevation of the 20 more big urban centres to the level of autonomous administrative divisions. Those could be -
1) Sri Nagar, 2) Ludhiana, 3) Jaipur, 4) Kanpur, 5) Lucknow, 6) Indore, 7) Raipur, 8) Patna, 9) Jamshedpur 10) Guwahati, 11) Bhubaneswar, 12) Ahmedabad, 13) Surat, 14) Pune, 15) Visakhapatnam, 16) Coimbatore, 17) Kochi, 18) Kozhikode, 19) Nagpur and 20) Bhopal.

*Tried to make the list as exclusive as possible.

* Those cities would have sufficient financial powers to raise funds.

* Now we need to invest some big amounts of money in those cities for infrastructure development. Something like 50K crore for each megacites (total 3.5 lakh crore) and 15K crore each for 20 urban centres (total 3 lakh crore) per year for 5 years. A big percentage of that amount should be private investments both domestic and foreign.

* Discussions with local citizen bodies and civic socities should be encouraged regarding the development processes.

* Transparency should be optimal to reduce corruption.

* Cleanliness, better roads, intra city metro connections, inter city high speed trains, construction of special commercial zones, registration and formalization of street vendors, auto drivers and maids etc, encouragement of startups, safe and faultless electricity supply, creating green zones, cleaning the city rivers and canals, ensuring safe drinking water, rehabilitation of slum dwellers, creation of high tech internet based municipal services, retraining and modernization of city police, creation of faster courts, creation of powerful and super efficient citizen's grievance address management etc should be the focus.

* If succefully implemented those cities would become models which rest of the nation will follow.

* What do you think ?",1591295918.0,[deleted]

PM CARES collected $1.27 billion in two months. I donated a portion of my salary towards this fund but last week the PMO stated they won't share any details about it's expenditure with the public. Apparently an RTI was filed and PMO rejected it. 

The money is collected from the public and for the public. So I don't understand why they responded this way?

And to add to the confusion, this fund will be audited by a BJP fan. Someone who has deep ties with the BJP.

I love Modi's leadership, and I know whatever he does is for the betterment of this country. But now I am having second thoughts because this fund is like a scam. Thoughts??

Update: I know what an idiot I was to support Modi, just because my family supported him. Though my knowledge on politics is quite mediocre, I will use this instance to learn more about BJP's governance.

Please stop shitting on me for not being politically literate. I'm coming back to my senses and I would appreciate support from y'all. I mean, isnt this like a small win against Modi's regime?

## Economy

>Well, this one had something going for it and then we couldn't create the jobs to support it. Our politicians love boasting when press releases state that India will have the youngest population among major economies in the near future, but having a young demographic needs to be balanced with good policies and job creation if that were happening, India's economy wouldn't have slowed down at the beginning of 2020. But, now I have full confidence in the BJP govt, that once the dust settles everything will be blamed on coronavirus and they will emphasize the fact that "" We are hurt, We feel you, We tried our best but this was unprecedented "". Did you try your best though?  Really, did you?

## Education

>Delhi! Oh, you beautiful city! You restored my faith in the Indian Public in the Delhi elections this year. But what about the rest of the country, Our schools and the curriculum is outdated, rote and routine. We might as well start literally boiling books and feeding them to kids, that would give them the same amount of knowledge that our education system currently does. Coaching institutes are getting bigger, churning better robots, the whole exam-marks culture is pumping out huge numbers of people who just want to get that ""pass mark"", and then the public complains India isn't doing cutting edge research. Because we don't know what that is! We never got to know what learning is, we were only told what ""remembering"" is. Teachers are absent, midday meals are ""roti-namak"", more and more of engineers are not employable, same goes for MBA. Education has become a business first, rather than a place of learning. Only in India, every JD is attached with "" [M.Tech](https://M.Tech), [B.Tech](https://B.Tech), xoxoxo 3+ years experience"". Dude, tell me what you want me to solve and see if I can do it!

## Heritage

>Talking about this topic could take days, and is far too complex to put down in a single paragraph, but do you as an Indian, regardless of which policies you support, feel that our ancestors would be proud of what India has become? For those who don't know, the Indian subcontinent was divided among many states, but none of these states had defined state boundaries, in fact that is also a British import, If you go further back, the nazi conspiracies, the saying that keeps being tossed around ""all the knowledge in the world is int the Vedas"". Well, I ask you this, we have had the Vedas for almost 2500 years now, how come we could never come to apply that knowledge? Ram killed Ravana and was deeply dismayed, and we talk of killing 100s of RamRajya citizens in his name. Not a lot of intellect is required to figure out, that isn't something even Ram would be proud of. Yet, we keep talking of glories of the past while we light the flames on the pyre of our future.

## Arts

>When was the last time you saw a classical art form? I haven't in a while, and our creative industry would rather select ostentatious foreign destinations, decade-old remakes, south Indian remakes, western remakes. 1.3 billion people and we can't produce an Idea that fuses Indian classical with modern arts? Are we really being creative? Our films do not represent the Indian population anymore, apparently, India is now a country of mixed origin people, trying hard to imitate the western culture. No matter how funny some kung fu movies might be, they made their martial art a global phenomenon, how many people in India have heard about Kalaripayattu?

I could go on and on, but that would make the thread too long, so I'll shorten it, let's not talk about religion or social issues. What about Sports? 1.3 billion people and Michael Phelps has more Olympic golds :). Of course, India has bigger problems to solve right now, but as stated above, we aren't really doing that either. Infrastructure, we change the measuring methods to inflate our numbers when it comes to building roads ([Read Here](https://thelogicalindian.com/news/new-highway-measurement/)) and claim it a victory. We see our country in trouble and pour thousands of crores and then our leaders beat around the bush but we still know nothing of how the money was spent? ([Read Here](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pm-cares-fund-now-has-an-independent-auditor-pmo-is-the-trusts-head-office/articleshow/76342540.cms)). This wasn't something of national security, this was money by our people for our people? What could possibly be the reason for not declaring the transactions and methods of distribution? If all that wasn't depressing enough, the manhandling of coronavirus, the predicted shrinking of the Indian economy, the pathetic display of propaganda and fact bending on our TV news channels, and now finally this. NEPAL! I'm not any fear monger, I'm not an ultra-nationalist, but literally, how did we let it come this? NEPAL! A country which shares open borders with us, whose citizens can not only work in India but they can also take up govt jobs in India, even military ones! NEPAL !. How did we drop the ball on this one? India is literally being surrounded by states that display animosity towards us. And let's not get started on BLM ( it's a noble cause but) , Bollywood and its hypocrisy aside, I'm dark-skinned and I can assure you most of the country has skin colour bias. That's the thing about biases, people don't know they have it. Just like when you were kids and your classmates decided to call the dark kid kala or gorilla or whatever and you joined in because it was good fun. Trust me, you don't remember it, but the kid you all teased, he hasn't been able to forget it. AND WE ARE ALL THE SAME RACE! LOOK INWARDS SOMTIMES FOLKS!

https://preview.redd.it/p3q6gicet7551.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6687dc7f885a674992aa8e1bbc78ac2aba9cc6

### Tl;dr

Licensed Service Area Units of the Department of Telecom sought bulk Call Data Records from Telecom Service Providers as per official documents revealed through RTI. The RTI responses do not support DoT's claim that bulk Call Data Records were only sought for analysing call drops, and they reveal glaring factual inconsistencies and legal deficiencies.

### Concern expressed by AACTI

The issue of bulk gathering starts from press reports in the Economic Times and the Indian Express dated [**March 15, 2020**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/dot-units-seeking-bulk-call-data-record-in-routine-telcos-raise-concern/articleshow/74637369.cms?from=mdr) and [**March 18, 2020**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/call-data-records-government-surveillance-6319528/). These news reports indicated that telecom operators wrote to the Department of Telecom (DoT) expressing concerns about surveillance through requisition of bulk Call Data Records (CDRs) by Licensed Service Area (LSA) units. Subsequent to this, we have obtained the text of this letter through a request filed under the Right to Information Act, 2005 . 

On February 12, 2020 the Apex Advisory Council for Telecom in India (AACTI) wrote to the Ld. Secretary, Department of Telecom in which they highlighted that: 

* **Sensitivity of CDRs :** “Call Data Records (CDRs)... contain various personal and sensitive information such as MSISDNs, IMSI, IMEI, Location etc….”. This is substantiated by the information sought by Department of Telecom's email dated 15.01.2020 that demands information for 13 fields including, “Calling Party Telephone Number, Called Party Telephone Number, Call Date, Call Time, Call duration (in seconds), Complete First Cell ID, Complete Last Cell ID, Call Type (IN/OUT/SMS\_IN/SMS\_OUT), IMEI of Party, IMSI of Party, Type of Connection (Pre-paid/Post-paid), SMS Centre Number / GGSN Address/SGSN address, First Roaming Network Circle ID.”
* **Breach of existing SoPs :** As per the AACTI, “various SOPs have been issued by the Department of Telecom” dated 04.08.2016 and 02.04.2019 and include, “various provisions like first ascertaining the identity of the subscriber, examining the justification carefully, detailing purpose for seeking CDRs and not using such CDRs received for any other purpose…”. “Various LSA units of DoT are not adhering to this process” and, “almost all LSA units of DoT continue to seek one day CDR details from the Licensee…”. In addition LSA units of DoT units also continue to seek additional CDR details on ad hoc basis. For this instance, CDR details sought on February 2-4, 2020 in Delhi is cited.
* **Violation of privacy:** The AACTI cites a lack of justification and purpose limitation by stating that, “neither the intended purpose for requirement of CDRs.. has been provided”. It further states, “CDRs sought for specific routes/areas may lead to allegations of surveillance…. of Ministers, MPs, Judges etc.”.

### Statement by DoT

Subsequent to this a [**Press Information Bureau statement dated March 18, 2020** ](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1607003)was made by the DoT. The stated justifications proceed on various grounds including the following: 

* **Big data tool to analyse call drops:** “For this purpose, data on calls made from mobiles in any tower coverage area is analysed to ascertain calls terminated within 30 seconds and made again,” the department said. “DoT will be better equipped to take up such cases and areas with the telecom service providers based on actual data. For this purpose, total data of calls made during any particular time period from the identified cell phone tower locations from where the complaints are received is collected to enable analysis,” it added.
* **Data is anonymous:** “However, this data is anonymous and does not contain names of either the maker or receiver of calls. There is no infringement of privacy of any person. No personal details are collected. There is no tracking of any phone number.” Further, ""it has been decided to seek such data only for short time period i.e. three to six hours normally covering the peak load of traffic on the Network for any cell tower.”
* **Legal power and safeguards:** “It is further clarified that DoT is empowered under Rule 419 of the Indian Telegraph Rules 1951 to access such anonymous data for improving network quality. Moreover, DoT has also put in place an in house standard operating procedure so that any authorization of such access to call drop data can be approved only by very senior officers.”

### RTI requests and answers provided

On March 19, 2020 the Internet Freedom Foundation filed RTI requests with various LSA units of the DoT seeking further information why these CDRs were sought. The text of the RTI is provided below.

>“The information sought herein relates to the following two news reports - 'DoT units seeking bulk call data record in routine, telcos raise concern' published by the Economic Times on 15 March, 2020 and 'Cellphone operators red-flag ‘surveillance’ after Govt wants call records of all users' published in the Indian Express on March 18, 2020. Please provide information in response to the following queries:  
>  
>1. Please provide copies of all letters sent by the local departments of the DoT to TSPs from December 2019 to February, 2020 with regard to obtaining call data records including  
>  
>(a) a full list of all TSPs with whom such directives were filed;  
>  
>(b) all licensed service areas where such requests were made;  
>  
>(c) the dates for which such information was sought; and  
>  
>(d) the duration/time period for which these call data records were sought.  
>  
>2. Please clarify the enabling legal provision under which the requests for call data records were made.  
>  
>3. Please state the official purpose for which such bulk call data records were sought from TSPs  
>  
>4. Please provide a copy of the complaint filed by the Cellular Operators Association of India on February 12, 2020 to Mr. Anshu Prakash, Secretary, Department of Telecommunications with regard to these requests to obtain the call data records.”  


The responses we received are contained in the following table:

https://preview.redd.it/xri08iwjt7551.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=63d65d3823c56745f884d26c98e572482c0a82e7

### A quick and dirty analysis

We have conducted a preliminary analysis of the RTI responses. This analysis is without prejudice to broader legal claims that are [**pending adjudication**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-rejoinder-in-pil-seeking-surveillance-reform/) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.

Without prejudice to other legal arguments, the following is just a preliminary comment based on comparison of the information from RTI replies with the PIB press release:

* **Use case does not match:** There is a fundamental mismatch between the DoT press release cited above and the responses received through RTI. The records queried are for a multiplicity of reasons and none of them mention call drops. The stated justifications of the LSAs are varied and diverse. They also draw from legal powers and justifications which are independent of Rule 419A which is not cited in any of the RTI responses or the actual correspondence.
* **Weak claim of anonymity and data limitation:** The claims of anonymity are premised on the absence of the name of the subscriber and their residential address. However, the bulk CDRs are sought for all customers with data fields that have at least 13 fields where the inference of the identity of a person is relatively easy. At present mobile numbers are used as an identity field in several e-governance databases. Further, the stated justification of querying information for calls limited to durations of 30 seconds does not match the text of the actual requests.
* **SoPs are not legal and deficient:** The SoPs cited as analysed in the past in a pending litigation filed by the Internet Freedom Foundation are legally deficient and do not constitute as adequate safeguards ([**link**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-rejoinder-in-pil-seeking-surveillance-reform/)). Further the operational requisitioning conflicts with the SoPs. For instance as per the bulk collection of CDRs violates the very nature of the SoP safeguards which focus on requisitioning specific and individualised information. 

In light of the above, the justifications offered by DoT in the PIB Press Release appear to be a face saving measure which do not hold up on closer scrutiny. As AACTI had noted, some of areas for which bulk CDRs were requisitioned include places where Members of Parliament and Judges reside. This creates a very real possibility of the Executive surveilling other branches of government i.e. the Legislature and Judiciary, which are intended to act as a check on the Executive within our constitutional scheme. In addition to this, bulk CDRs also facilitate mass surveillance of ordinary citizens and enable the government to keep a watch on our everyday interactions. These problems are emblematic of the larger need for surveillance reform in India and it is only through independent oversight that we can ensure the government acts in a transparent and accountable manner.

Most businesses and factories were closed from 24th March to 17th May. Some businesses such as restaurants, saloons are almost closed till now. They were ordered to close down but they were not provided with any relief from the government regarding the rent and charges like fixed electricity charges or M.C. Tax for a commercial unit. 

In our industrial plot, there are around 13 tenants where the 4 have already left because they are unable to pay the rent for upcoming months. Others are thinking to either change the location to a cheaper one or planning to close the business. 

Rent disputes are happening at just every place in my knowledge. Very few of the landlords have waived two months rent and offered 50% off in rental charges till a few months. But this number of good people is very small

When there is no income for the commercial units, why should the landlord enjoy the rent from closed businesses? Shouldn't the government cancel the rent for the period of lockdown for the businesses which were closed? They haven't even waived of the fixed electricity charges for the lockdown period and are shamelessly sending the bills for the lockdown period.

Small businesses were already struggling before the lockdown. Now the government has made sure we aren't struggling anymore as we'll be closed for good.

No state government whether it be BJP or INC have asked to waive off any of the charges for the dying industries in India. 

Instead, our ruling party has announced a notional financial package which in reality gives nothing to anyone.

### Tl;dr

Today, we sent a[ joint representation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3/view?usp=sharing) to the Prime Minister's Office that is endorsed by 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals against the mandatory use of the Aarogya Setu App dated May 1, 2020. This joint representation becomes all the more urgent given yesterday's [direction by the Home Ministry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXzfI9uPv0Qr4YZBKXwk_1Z1M2skYfzl/view?usp=sharing) for the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu and for it's ""100% coverage"" especially in all workplaces. Violation of this direction can lead to criminal penalties thereby Aarogya Setu now not only impacts the data privacy of workers, or can lead to risks of exclusion and misidentification, a person not having it on their phone can also be charged with a criminal offence. This marks a dramatic and clear shift in government policy on Aarogya Setu from, ""encouragement"" towards coercion and increases the legitimacy of the demands articulated by the joint representation.

### A joint representation co-signed by 45 organisations and more than 100 people

In [yesterday's post](https://internetfreedom.in/workers-privacy-during-covid-19/) we released a joint representation signed by 37 organisations and 75 individuals against mandating the use of the Aarogya Setu on workers. After we opened it for further sign-ons this number has grown to 45 organisations and more than 100 individuals who have expressed solidarity against the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu on workers. The endorsements are from a broad swathe of Indian society including trade unions, people's movements, digital rights organizations, public health experts, former civil servants and bureaucrats, activists, academics, technologists, journalists, lawyers etc. 

A copy of the [joint representation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ELi-Q9FG-eapNFEzVeuJqTROFFrUflT3) was sent today with a covering letter to the Prime Minister's Office with a copy to Ministry of Home Affairs and other central government ministries. 

To this we attached [a covering letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RR3tBnJCSkQvSDp0uVcMQr6C2RILgqg4/view?usp=sharing) dated May 2, 2020 which further notes with concern yesterday evening's development of the issuance of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) has been issued on May 1, 2020 around 6:00 PM by the Ministry of Home Affairs requiring mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu. This goes against the core demands of the joint representation which is attached to this covering letter. 

### Aarogya Setu : Not only mandatory but also criminal penalties

The Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A), which has been issued under Section 10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates for the mandatory installation and operation of Aarogya Setu in two specific ways:

1. First, after classification of the districts into three zones, for the Red (Hotspots) Zones, a further sub-classification has been made for, “*containment zones*”. As per the Order under Section 3(iii), “*The local authority shall ensure 100% coverage of Aarogya Setu app among the residents of Containment Zones*”.
2. Second, at Para 15(i) further reference is made for, “*all the district magistrates*” to, “*strictly enforce the lockdown measures*” for, “*public and workplaces, as specified in Annexure I*”. This direction extends to all three zones. Annexure I further states at Point No. 15 that, “*Use of Aarogya Setu app shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public. It shall be responsibility of the Head of the respective Organisations to ensure 100% coverage of this app among employees*”.

Presently here are no exceptions or conditionality provided in these directions which place emphasis on 100% coverage in effect meaning total and complete mandatory installation of Aarogya Setu for all workers, all across the country. The order further indicates criminal penalties for non-compliance in Paragraph No. 16 that states, “*Any person violating these lockdown measures and the National Directives for Covid-19 Management will be liable to be proceeded against as per the provision of Section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC and other legal provisions as applicable*”. The specific provision that may be attracted for prosecution under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 is Section 51(b) that provides for a maximum punishment of up to 1 year for disobedience, and 2 years when such actions may lead to a loss of life. The penalty for conviction under Section 188 of the IPC extends to 6 months imprisonment.

Hence, the mandatory imposition of Aarogya Setu is not only an issue of data privacy but second order harms which spring from it now includes loss of urban mobility, use of public spaces and transit, livelihood and personal liberty for millions of Indians all over India. Specially those without smartphones devices given the lack of any exemption categories. 

### Intention for further action

We at IFF in continuation of this Joint Representation dated May 1, 2020 and through this covering letter have requested specific review of Order No 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) and will also be shortly reaching out to each one of the co-signees and collaborators urging them to send individual letters of concern as much as examine further advocacy actions against this grave breach.

We also remain open to any suggestions and advice on what we can do better, or different not only through our collaborators, but even members of the public. We invite you to write to us, or discuss these issues over at the [Internet Freedom Forum](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

As stated before we at IFF will continue conducting public advocacy, awareness especially through digital media as well as continue to engage pro-actively with all government institutions on the issues concerning Aarogya Setu. This includes representations, RTI requests as well as other legal remedies which may be examined at an appropriate stage in consultation with IFF's legal team and several lawyers who continue to volunteer thier time and labour towards protecting fundamental rights. 

We remain committed working with more organisations and individuals to broaden the scope and improve the impact of interventions around Aarogya Setu. Please do feel free to reach out to us.

And India is genuinely blessed to have one of the finest economic genius of our times in Dr. Manmohan Singh and his team.

Without going into much details, one of his economic and foreign policy move when he was the Prime Minister of India, was to allow China to import goods into India and increase trade with China, without equal reciprocation.

So much that by the time his term came to an end, a decade later, [China was India's second largest trading partner](https://qz.com/183134/china-is-now-indias-top-trading-partner-and-one-of-its-least-liked/). This earned him a lot of ire and some indian businesses, and their representative BJP / RSS, criticised and bullied him as being a ""weak PM"" who ""caved"" to Chinese demands.

There are many sound reasoning behind this policy:

1. It would highlight the weakness in indian industries in certain sectors to compete globally, and the government could then brainstorm policies to address these shortcomings and make our industries more robust. (We would have seen those policies if the UPA had got another term).

2. It would help indian businesses grow and compete better. A good example is [our pharmaceutical industry which is one of the largest](https://www.raconteur.net/healthcare/india-pharmaceutical-industry) in the world, and chinese imports of many raw active ingredients helped them grow. 

3. It makes China more dependent on us as attacking us comes at a huge economic cost to them (not to mention a high military cost too, as India is no pushover today when it comes to our military strength).

4. We can also afford to be more lenient about the trade disparity and China's protectionist attitude in the short term, as a trade imbalance means our economy is more insulated if China attacks us (they will be hurt more than us). (Note: but only in the short term!).

Ofcourse, China too has fine tuned their policy and these continued low-intensity border skirmishes (that happened during the UPA period too) are aimed to keep the border issue alive, and to test our leadership and our response. Unfortunately both with Dokhlam and now in Ladakh, PM Modi's flaws in leadership and foreign policy is apparent and worrying.

(Note that this disparity in trade isn't meant to be a permanent thing, but a medium term policy to buy us time till we strengthen our own economy and military. And we were doing precisely that during UPA-1 and 2. Also note that this was just ONE of the many policies with regards to China that the UPA administration implemented.)",1592531846.0,I respect Dr. Manmohan Singh but I don't think his foreign policy was anything extraordinary. Atleast it was not shit like Modi's. Nationalism policy of his govt. has become a liability. He keep making blunder after another.

1564,PSA: Don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cards,125,ftybqp,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ftybqp/psa_dont_opt_for_the_3month_moratorium_unless_you/,False,23,Business/Finance,"I see a lot of misinformation floating around about the RBI moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, I guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
When you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ₹20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ₹60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ₹1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      

Credit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ₹1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ₹1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",1585903576.0,[deleted]

The Congress party had debated and planned for 20 years on how to deal with the Indian military after the independence . Finally when we achieved independence , a carefully made plan which was being made since the 1930s was put into action . This involved a slew of measures '

&#x200B;

1. The position of Commander in chief was immediately abolished . In British India , this post had massive power , with the commander in chief reporting directly to the British government . The new Indian government abolished this post out of fear that he can coordinate a coup against the young government . Three new posts , one for each of the military wing , were created . They were : 
   1. Chief of army staff 
   2. Chief of naval staff
   3. Chief of the air staff
2. Salaries of the officers and soldiers were slashed to bring them down to civilian levels . The large salaries paid to officers of British Indian military (which included British soldiers in India) were a massive drain on the Indian government budget . As a result , even if the government did not care about coups , the cutbacks in salary was necessary to free up budget money for governance . 
3. The intelligence bureau were ordered to tap phones , intercept letter and carry out surveillance of all Indian army officers to keep a track of their whereabouts and actions . Many Indian officers were aware about this and started to cutback on internal communication . 
4. The powers of Military intelligence department was massively reduced . All domestic intelligence operations were to be solely done and headed by the Intelligence bureau . 
5. Rules were made to govern when and where military uniform could be worn in public life 
6. In order to address the ethnic imbalance that Indian army inherited from the British times , the government made a decision to pursue diversity in promotions to higher jobs . This was done to ensure that too much ethnic homogeneity does not embolden the officer corps to carry out a coup. This policy however caused many officers to retire prematurely . 
7. The military was stripped of its power to formulate its own budget and carry out its own expenditure . This was now to be done solely by the Ministry of defense (staffed by civilian Indian government workers) . 
8. The martial race theory was never believed by the congress party and with independence , it was officially consigned to dustbin.
9. A new military academy was raised in Pune . This was done to ensure that all officers do not come from the same , single military academy . The logic behind this was that if all officers continued to come from the same academy then they could develop strong bonds and connections in their start of careers which could later prove dangerous to the civilian government . The new academy along with lateral entry of officers was to ensure the heterogeneity of officer corps 
10.  The intelligence bureau was ordered to keep track and carry out surveillance of Indian army troop movements inside the borders and especially around the capital . This policy is still followed . During UPA era , congress got massively scared once of a routine troop movement during midnight , thinking that a coup was about to happen 
11. The strength of paramilitary forces was massively increased . There were two reasons behind this
   1. It was to ensure that Indian army did not have to carry out domestic operations against Indian civilians . The aim of this was to insulate the army from domestic politics
   2. It was to make sure that the government had some muscle to deter any future coup . The Indian military troop presence in the capital was kept minimal . Massive deployment of Paramilitary troops in Delhi was done 
12. The Indian government did not allow future interactions with western officers . This was unlike Pakistan , where the Pakistani army maintained and still maintains contacts with British and American army officers after independence for training 
13. Popular and outspoken military officers were made ambassadors to foreign countries and shipped off there to ensure that they don't cause trouble in India 

&#x200B;

While we know that these measures were successful , it is also necessary to  point out the harm they caused 

1. The officer corps of the Indian army was badly damaged . Krishna menon's outright antagonism caused many good officers to quit prematurely . This deterioration of officer corps  played a big part in the 1962 china war which was a disaster for India . The entire world was shocked how the Indian army , which have served spectacularly in the second world war , folded so quickly against china 
2. The civilian interference in all matters of army , even operational matters , contributed to the disaster of the 1962 war with China . Many senior officers had repeatedly told Nehru that the forward policy of his government was too aggressive and would lead to a war . Their inputs were not taken seriously by the bureaucrats
3. The planning and procurement of the military equipment and material started taking a lot of time since it was now entirely done by ministry of defense . This problem still exists today",1590104460.0,Do you think 'conquering PoK' could lead that?

Serious issue - need help/suggestions  
TLDR   : Vengeful father  most likely to withdraw financial support after I   pointed out his  behavioral faults in a fight. I'm waiting to join my   job after college  (Im in the final year of an excellent college). How   do I cut myself off from him financially?

Context   : I am an Indian girl.  I am undergoing a tough family situation. My   father dominates  everyone in the house and thinks he has the right to   do it because he  earns money for the house (sole earner). My mother has   been living in  submission for years but I cannot stay quiet and   constantly display  passive aggression when my father bosses around or   doesn't even pick up  his own tea cups/plates. This passive aggressive   behavior finally  resulted in a big fight two days ago where he did not   listen, shouted at  me, blocked all means of rational communication by   exerting his  dominance. He said vengefully , ""now I will stop taking   all  responsibilities and leave you all to your fate.""

Issue   : Main  issue is - HOW do I financially cut off from him? The only   dilemma right  now is - how do I move to my job city, pay first month   rent on my own  without taking HIS money? He is a very dangerous man and   will surely  exert his dominance by not giving me any money further.   And to put it  bluntly, I only need him financially now, all emotional   ties are gone.

Rent for 3 BHK (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. Electricity is cheap. Gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

I'm sure several current and former NRIs will concur with at least some of my sentiments.

Like it or not, 99.9% of goods in all sectors tailored for the Indian market are designed with one thing and one thing in mind only: the race to the bottom. 

Be it FMCG, where the practice is to reduce quantity and use substandard materials to meet price targets, or be it automobiles, where no Indian manufacturer even *dares* to target the affluent.

Sure, there are some Indian brands that are comparable in quality to foreign brands dominating India. However, the vast majority are utter shit. Everyone remembers Videocon, Onida and BPL.

If any of you have eaten fresh cheese, even the most common: cheddar and mozzarella, you know that imported fresh cheeses taste a lot, lot better than the Amul/Britannia processed cheeses in the Indian market. A few Indian brands try to compete, but the quality is not there. Supply of the right kind of milk is important. On the other hand, I will give you that paneer made from Indian milk is much, much better than paneer made from the milk I've tasted abroad.

I've yet to find a mass-manufactured brand of bread that comes even close to comparable to mass-manufactured bread I've eaten abroad. Not sliced bread, but *real* bread, be it ciabatta loaves, baguettes or focaccia. Mass-produced bread in India is cut with sugar, which is not that common in native English-speaking countries. Either the quality of the flour supplied is either not good enough to sustain the yeast without adding sugar or the companies want to cut down on the cost of flour in the bread. I don't know enough about the economics of bread-making to definitively comment on that. What I do know is that this leads to unnecessarily large bubbles and reduces the texture of the bread into a joke.

Chocolate and ice cream are cut with palm oil, which in other countries results in a violation of food labelling standards. In the US and Canada, ice cream laced with palm oil is called frozen <flavour> dessert, and not <flavour> ice cream. Needless to say, it forms the cheapest rung of the processed food industry.

It's not all doom and gloom though: the lemons available in Canada, where I lived for a few years, taste sugary-sour, while Indian lemons are the sourness incarnate. I prefer the latter. But if I had to weigh the kind of fresh food available in western countries (and yes, I have been to enough places in the west over my relatively short time on this planet) to the kind of fresh food available in India, the balance would be overwhelmingly tilted in favour of the west. In any part of the western world, I can get several varietals of onions (the bulbous kind, FYI, not onions vs spring onions) each with a different taste while in India I am lucky to get two kinds. I can get seven or eight different kinds of potatoes, of different sizes, colours and skins, while in India I get maybe three, all with the same kind of skin and virtually the same colour. The sizes also tend to be at least twice as big. For potatoes this means I can cook longer French Fries. Sure, it also means that smaller sizes tend to be less available, but unlike penis sizes, bigger is actually better here (well, most of the time).

Then there's the irony that a lot of brands perceived as and priced as Indian are actually owned by foreign companies. Think of brands like Maggi, Cadbury and Lux. There are many, many more, but this gives you a gist. Even entire companies dominating the Indian market have foreign multinationals as their promoter entities. Nestle and Unilever being the two most important examples. Maruti-Suzuki's name and shareholding structure today tells you all you need to know of their story.

I wouldn't touch a Mahindra or Tata vehicle because they don't know how to make good cars. I want a decent engine and good looks too. Why would I spend on an XUV when a far better looking Hyundai Elantra completely fits my needs while also coming with good gizmos and probably a much better service network? Plus I don't remember when I heard Mahindra use a petrol engine in their cars (hint: never). Tata's designs are still pretty shit, and they seriously need to take a leaf out of Toyota's books on reliability if they have any intention of becoming a serious manufacturer in India. Their logo, frankly speaking, sucks, and their designs suck even more. If they just tell Jaguar to design their low-cost car portfolio and send the Tata Motors design team to learn from Jaguar maybe they'll have a chance. 

Then a lot of foreign brands in the textiles sector actually either manufacture their fabric in India for the Indian market, or they license their brand to Indian companies. Especially true in the middle and upper middle class segment, with brands like Lee, Wrangler and Levi's, and even in the upper class segment, with brands like Lacoste, 80% of whose Indian portfolio is manufactured in India (the imports being substantially more expensive). Want to know the names of some Indian companies marketing foreign brands? Here's two: Arvind Mills and Inditex. The former is self-explanatory, while the latter is owned by the Tata Group. **Here's the irony: Modi's biggest donor is promoting videshi goods!**

I will admit, it's an appealing call: foreign brands became famous because people bought them in their local countries and promoted the brand. However that completely whitewashes the notion that most of the market-leading brands worldwide are actually consolidated into massive conglomerates. That many of these brands actually failed to turn a profit in the long term, which led to said consolidation. Or that many of these brands originate in completely different countries from each other, and doing an India against the World drama is just a disguised form of Galapagos Syndrome.

You want Indian brands to go global? Perhaps give us global-quality goods first? Here's a hint: you *can't*. Even foreign brands that set up shop in India target the lowest rung for volume sales.

All of these loans were funnelled through a shady website www.psbloansin59minutes.com Govt claimed this site was owned by SIDBI  and in which public sector banks were shareholders. However one **Jinand Shah** was the founder of this site. Suddenly, this site got authority to process all loans. Thats where the scam starts.

This site charged a good fee around Rs 1000 to 2000 per application. This was ""processing fee"". On creating an account with this site, they would provide ""in principle"" approval, which was another scam. Even MEMEs/entrepreneurs with in principle approval got rejected later by banks during actual disbursement of loans 

[Indian bank had rejected 77% of all applications](https://www.moneylife.in/article/loan-in-59-minutes-indian-bank-has-rejected-77-percentage-of-applications-sbi-48-percentage/56871.html) Similarly many other banks rejected a lot of applications. Despite all this, the shady company collected processing fee from lakhs of MSMEs and make crores out of this jhoomla. 

In similar fashion, Mudi 2.0 is starting new jhoomla of loans for MSMEs. Be careful, it may again be routed via shady Gujrati pals of RSS

And to my surprise, I actually likes it way better than, chrome. And when I say ""better"" it means better in STABILITY and PERFORMANCE. And one more thing is that it is also based on Chromium, but thats just it, it has whole new page processing kit, web player, page rendering engine etc. The simplicity of it just feeels right.

But with Edge, this issue suprisingly was not happening. A plus point for me.

In February, I got into a new project for banking client. I was told that the project would be in my domain/skillset. 2 months went away in onboarding the whole team, including Developers and QA. After few days, my Team lead suddenly tells me that I'll have to do manual testing, which is low profile job and you can't learn anything. I was really upset. There was no way out from this project. They don't even release people from the project. I thought I'll cooperate for some time. Now I really regret wasting my time, and I feel like they did me dirty. 5-6 months of my precious time got wasted for nothing. Although I'm on notice period and June is my last month to work here.
I am now thinking to complaint to the DM. Is this a good solution? I feel like getting some sort of compensation for the time wasted. Even though I'm not sure if I'll change company at this point of time, and decide to stay within the same organization, they're still not willing to release me from this account, despite wasting my time.
Any suggestions?",1591006924.0,"The company doesn't owe you anything apart from your salary. The projects that you are handed are purely based on their discretion. You cannot choose a project.

Many things to look at when one opts for electric. Plus the comparison is also with petrol motorcycles and scooters. Why should I buy electric when petrol is already there, proved itself. 

1. Indian market is all about price point. Need to price it competitively. Plus which segment one is targeting. Are you making an electric bike to replace splendor or replace honda unicorn or pulsar 220 etc. 

2. After sales service - splitting it into a few more parts 1. Ease of getting my bike serviced, 2. Availability of parts, 3. Also the cost of the service (each service) 4. Number of service stations in the country and RSA support. 

3. The main point - infrastructure - Charging stations. Be it in apartments or on the roads, this needs to increase. I don't want to get stranded in the middle of road knowing there is no place to charge it at all. 

4. The main reason why one shifts from petrol to electric is because of eco-friendly nature, we are paying for electricity in comparison to paying for petrol. Of course, electricity *maybe* cheaper than petrol. But the fact is, in India, coal is the major producer of electricity (though we are trying to move away, still it leads the chart). And producing electricity through coal is still causing pollution. 

Thats my view. Happy to be corrected. "

Source: Washington Post. (A very liberal newspaper)

In 2019: More cops were killed than unarmed people were killed (all races).

There were a total of 1004 killings in 2019 by police. Of those, 802 were noted on race of the officer and suspect. 371 were white and 236 were black.

The vast majority of the 802 WERE armed and blacks were more likely to be armed. More whites were killed (This stat has nothing to do with population).

Only 10 unarmed black people were killed (9 men and 1 woman). In 5 of the cases the officer WAS ATTACKED before the shooting. 1 was allegedly an accident. 4 were during a pursuit or a standoff. In 2 of those 4 the police officer was charged.

In 2015 (under Obama) 38 unarmed black men were killed compared to the 10 I noted above in 2019.

2019 was the safest year since these statistics have been recorded (2015) by the Washington post.

Here's something to consider.,281,guekx5,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/guekx5/india_getting_rid_of_chinese_hardware_heres/,False,78,Science/Technology,"While you could probably name a quality Indian alternative for every Chinese app, the same is not true for electronics hardware. Why? As a failed hardware entrepreneur, I know exactly why.

Indians love inexpensive stuff, and if you want hardware for cheap, you've got to go to the source. And guess where the source to all of the major hardware components is? China. You will struggle to find anything in India. Even if you do, it's probably imported from China for a far cheaper price than what a manufacturer could build on Indian soil.

Smartphones? LOL, they're the most competitive electronic niche that if you ought to stand a chance, you'd have to have deep pockets, talented hardware engineers, and inexpensive high quality component manufacturers - something that Indian entrepreneurs will not find **in India**.

It's not one problem. It is many.

If we were to start today, first invite someone like TSMC to manufacture semiconductors in India on a large scale, and then fund local electronics component/display/battery/PCB manufacturers to subsidize their production until they're able to efficiently undercut the Chinese. (I know there aren't any display manufacturers in India. Videocon gave LCDs a shot but now they're bankrupt). Then subsidize plastic/aluminum/magnesium enclosure manufacturers so that *they* can undercut the Chinese. Lay down new rules and regulations that speed up electronics product development instead of creating bureaucratic hurdles for young hardware startups who don't have deep enough pockets. Create special zones across the country, far away from wildlife and residential areas, for all these companies to do all the polluting manufacturing and efficiently treat the waste byproducts, and lay out proper guidelines to do so. Force IITs and NITs to do some *real* research rather than wasting money and time repeating existing foreign research work in Indian labs. Oh, and most importantly, all that research can't be done on the peanut sized budget set aside for these institutes, time to cough up the cash. It'll be worth it, I promise.

Do all this, and maybe in 10 years India will stand on it's own feet.

We already missed the silicon race, and it cost us dearly. Let's not miss out on the quantum computing race - it's something every nation is a beginner at, with some getting slightly ahead, but we could still try and get there and build all the needed infrastructure along the way. Small incremental investments over time are easier than pumping a boatload of money at once. We have an opportunity to get in the game, let's not waste it.

Oh, and did I mention that creating a homegrown electronics industry like this will be a massive boost to the Indian commercial space industry? Go figure.

A collar strategy aims to reduce the premium paid for insurance of stocks to very low while keeping the opportunity for profits(limited).

Collar strategy in technical terms, we will follow it up with a no jargon explanation:

A collar strategy is selling a call and buying a put on an underlying  asset to protect value while paying/recieveing a small amount.

That is way too complicated for me. I understand this simply as:

If you own a house and want to protect your investmentyou can buy  house insurance. As with all insurance you need to pay a premium.  Detailed explanation in part 1 linked at the top.

At the same time, you can also earn rent from your house. Detailed explanation: [click here](http://thestockmarketinvestor.com/?page_id=759&preview=true)

Earning rent from the house is a strategy where we agree to give our  shares to a buyer at an agreed price(Strike Price) till a certain  date(expiry date). If on the agreed date the share price is higher than  the agreed price.

The buyer give us a rent(premium)    to have the opportunity of  owning the stock at the agreed price if price goes above the agreed  price on the agreed date.

If you take rent and pay insurance premium, then there is a chance  that the premium can be paid partially or fully by the rent.    **The appreciation in house value will go to you but partially.**

Subsitute stock/share in the statements above and that is a collar strategy.

The insurance is called buying a PUT option.

The rent is called writing/selling a CALL option.

You are not allowed to rent or insure a room in the house. You can  only insure or rent the entire house.    The house in case of stocks is  called a lot. Which is a set number of shares that can be either insured  or rented.

Lets take a look at what can happen over a few months:

Month 1:

Investment:

Opening stock price/Purchase price: 1,000

Lot: 200 Shares

Invested Amount: 1,000 x 200 = 200,000

Insurance:(Buy Put)

Strike Price: 80  
(If price of share is below 80 at the end of the month we will get (80 – end of month share price) \* lot)

Amount Invested: 1,000 x 200 = 200,000

Insured amount: 80% of stock value i.e. 1000 x 200 x 80/100 = 160,000

Insurance premium paid: 1% i.e. 1,000 x 200 x 1/100 = 2000

Our insurance expires at the end of the month.

Rent:(Sell Call aka Write Call)<

Agreed price(Strike Price): 110

This is the price at which the person paying rent will buy the shares, if price at the end of the month is above 110.

Rent received: 2% of stock value i.e. 1,000 x 200 x 2/100 = 4000

We keep the rent and shares if price is below 110 at end of the month.

What happens at the end of the month:

Case 1:

Share price remains same as start of the month

Investment value: Same as starting i.e. 200,000

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

Price is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent and the price  is above our    insurance point so Insurance company keeps the premium.

Case 2: Price is between 100 and 110, let us assume 105.

Investment value: Increased by (Current Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (105-100) x 200 = +1000

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

Price is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent and the price  is above our    insurance point so Insurance company keeps the premium.

Case 3: Price is above 110, let us assume 140.

Investment value: Increased by (Rent Strike Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (110-100) x 200 = +2000

We have to sell/give our shares to the person who paid us rent as the  agreed strike price is crossed. So our    selling price is 110.

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

Case 4: Price is below 80, let us assume 50.

Investment value: Decreased by (Current Price – Purchase Price) x number of shares = (50-100) x 200 = -10000

We insured our investment at 80 strike price. Now that the price is below 80 the insurance company will have to pay us.

Insurance pays us: (Insurance Strike Price – Current Price) x number of shares = (80-50) x 200 = +6000

Other amount: Rent recieved – Insurance premium paid = 4000-2000 = +2000

Price is below 110 (Strike price) so we keep the rent.

Total in Case 4 = Investment value decrease + Insurance payment received + Other amount = -10,000 + 6000 + 2000 = -2000

\-2000 is a 20% loss.

What happens if we didn’t have insurance and rent? (Current Price –  Purchase Price) x number of shares =    (50 – 100) x 200 = -5000 that is  a 50% loss

Even though our investment pick was wrong we are still in a much  better position with the collar strategy. If the case 1, 2    had been  true for even 2-3 months before the loss in case 4, we would be net  positive.

Note: chances of getting trades such as the ones used in the example  are low/non-existant.    We merely want to get clear on the concept.

Best driver I have seen driving: Fernando Alonso. A close second would be Hamilton even though I would like to see them again on equal cars under proper conditions to be able to judge properly. Hamilton=faster raw pace, Alonso=better racecraft, cunning way of driving. 

Best team I have seen: Mercedes. I don't particularly like them, but they are incredibly efficient.

Best season so far: 2012

Best looking car I have seen: Ferrari 2013: I know some don't like it but I love the nose (especially from the sides) and I think they nailed it with how straight/inclined it is. Also, the cars in that era were round/square enough with not too many winglets etc.

Favorite circuit: toss between Hungary/USA/Brazil/UK

Worst circuit: Monaco, hands down the mot boring races consistently. 

Random thoughts: I think Vettel is incredibly overrated and never liked his attitude on track or his race-craft. I value Sainz and I think he'd underrated. I find him composed and consistent, plus fast. Perhaps not the fastest in terms of raw speed but it looks like his maturity on track will bring him great results in the future. I think Leclerc is probably a better driver overall than Verstappen with their respective experience so far. IMO Verstappen is more instinctive and aggressive which pays off, but it also can be negative as he's more prone to mistakes. Leclerc is the opposite, and when you are talking about championships, it might be to his advantage. I like DRS.

He has a service based company from another country who mainly do outsource work from other countries. He has one client in India which always pays late. It was hard enough for him since the client didn't pay down payment either. He decided to work with them since they are one of the top companies in their specific industry.

It was a headache for him since he needed to constalty contact them in regards to payment but at least they made sure pay him albiet very late. This causes a cashflow problem but he sees it through till the end.

Last January he sent the final invoice for his last service but was never paid until now. He kept contacting them even before the lockdown but had gotten no response. He said that he was able to contact them a couple of weeks back only to get no concrete answer and was passed around to different contact persons in the company.

He said he doesn't know what to do. He still needed to pay his employees. Not to mention he need the money for as a buffer for their upcoming projects.

So they with billions in funding have money to spend on ads but not on drivers. Btw ola uber doesn't call drivers employees but partners due to which they are free of any EPF, insurance or corporate taxes.

I've been using ola corporate to travel least 1000km weekly and have very good drivers friends unaware about different cities but in Mumbai with CNG ola drivers earn 2 to 2.5k daily on a 12 hr shift making approx 60-70k monthly. This is when they own their cars.

I'm putting this forward because this amount is after ola takes its cut of Atleast 30% so they be making 25-30k per driver with very little operational costs like offices, rent etc.

&#x200B;

 Typical experiences of working at indian companies: 

1. Very informal culture - This leads to people being mischievous and lacking boundaries . 

2.  Domination - People can be very dominating even if they dont know any shit about anything. To rephrase in another words, people to extend their superiority over you by saying things loud or making you acknowledging their presence. Many people can be acting as if they are superior.  

3.  Impulsiveness- This is very common in Indian companies which means people do or say things for which they would repent later. This ofcourse doesn't stop them from being impulsive.   

4. Volatility - Very volatile work environment. Everything seems to be changing very fast, your tasks reassigned  or cancelled without asking you. 

5. Fickle-mindedness . Almost everybody seems to be fickleminded . People swallow words and change their style or way of interaction with you almost every day. Meetings are scheduled and cancelled or postponed without notice. Often you will have to learn that a meeting is cancelled at the time of the meeting . Meetings are also scheduled within a few hours of notice.  

6. Lack of punctuality - People in india start their day at 10 AM and end it at 7 pm . Whatever happens,  even if the company goes out of business,they wont change their arrival and departure as 8:00Am and 5:00 PM.  People are always running late for meetings, outdoor events.  

7. Hurrying - This is probably the easy to spot characteristic of indian companies. Almost everybody tries to hurry you and your projects will be squeezed as much as they can be even if there is no hurry in real world.  Maybe this is due to sadism or desire to cause stress.  

8; Attention disorders- People in Indian companies don't pay attention properly while on phone or communicating via email. They also dont care about whether the other person is a customer or not. Even the methods of talking with customers can be rude . They just send a email when its required to speak on phone. They speak on phone, when its required to send a email. They never get these things right at indian companies. Almost everybody uses mobile phone. This may be due to attention disorders or laziness. 

9. No work email - Lot of companies ask you to use your personal email or gmail, personal phone , whats app etc to communicate with you during business hours.  This has no exception. 

10 No separation of work and personal details -  People in india tend to talk about their home a lot at work places and also take their work to their home, telling everybody what they do at work.  

11. Religion - Lot of people in india bring religion with them. This includes displaying  rings with talismans, bangles , Dot on forehead, jewels,  putting idols  or photos of religion at their desks , doing religious rituals at work places wasting money of their employer. 

12. Employees are unimportant than customers. -  This is a easy to spot thing in indian companies. Most companies say things which can be bad which they wouldn't say to their customers. 

13. Lack of boundaries - People in indian companies gossip , share your personal information and pass it around the company  and even with their customers. Strangely enough, their customers also exhibit all of the above characteristics so it is not considered  a business blunder. 

14. High turnover of employees- Reasons above.",1591544323.0,"That religion point is bs. I am not cracking coconuts in office, neither am I asking my employer money for buying idols for my desk.

I mean, this guy does know that this whole thing started BECAUSE of China, right? Because the government refused to listen to doctors in Wuhan who were warning them of the outbreak?

Baseball players’ main seasons go for roughly 162 games per year, and that excludes practice, spring training, and travel. There is a significant risk to injury and atrophy due to the lack of time available for players to maintain their peak physical condition, and steroids in baseball were used in the 80s due to their strength building and anti-inflammatory effects. 

If team doctors safely administer steroids and prevent them from being abused, professional sports organizations should *actively encourage* their use.

**Tl;dr**

On May 23, 2020 the Commissioner of Police, Greater Mumbai issued Order no. CP/XI(6)/144/(Prohibitory Order)/2020 under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The order prohibits the dissemination of certain information through social media platforms such as Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok etc. We have sent a representation to the Mumbai Police as well as the Maharashtra Home Department asking them to review and amend the order. We also recommended them to issue an advisory with a draft SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that draws from the “Joint Declaration on ‘Fake News’, Disinformation and Propaganda” issued by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression dated March 3, 2017  .  


**What did the Mumbai Police do?**

The Mumbai Police on May 23, 2020 issued an [**Order**](https://www.timesnownews.com/mumbai/article/how-mumbai-polices-new-order-curbs-criticism-against-uddhav-thackeray-govt/596685) under Section 144, CrPC for regulation of social media use and to curb the spread of disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the order:

1. Under paragraph 4 of the Order, prohibited information includes incorrect and distorted facts as well as derogatory and discriminatory remarks which cause panic and confusion among the general public and incite mistrust towards the government.
2. Under paragraph 5, the Order also states that all persons designated as “admins” (administrators) on messaging and social media platforms will be held personally liable for the spread of any disinformation and derogatory and discriminatory remarks as stated above.
3. Under paragraph 6 of the Order, the admins have the personal responsibility of reporting such dissemination to the police .
4. The order states that any person contravening the order shall be punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which prescribes as punishment imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both. The order will remain in force until June 8, 2020.   


This order has been challenged in the High Court of Bombay in a [**Writ Petition**](https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/mumbai-police-order-making-group-admins-personally-liable-for-fake-news-on-covid-19-157458) filed by Mangal Prabhat Lodha, who is a sitting MLA from Malabar Hill and the BJP Mumbai President. In the writ petition, the order has been challenged on the basis that the order is vague and places restrictions on the right to free speech which are not reasonable.   


The order has been challenged on the basis that it fails the proportionality test as required under K. S. Puttuswamy v Union of India. The petition also states that the order can be used to target innocent people or people who are critical of the government response and thus be used to oppress dissent. Since criticism and dissent is essential in a democracy and also protected under the Constitution, the petition seeks to get the impugned order quashed.   


**Legal Deficiencies with the Order**

A. Void for vagueness : The order restricts freedom of speech by failing to define the phrase “distorting facts”

Since the order prohibits the dissemination of information that distorts facts, it is also incumbent upon the issuing authority to clearly define the ambit of what they consider to be distortion of facts. By failing to define the ambit clearly, the order suffers from the defect of being vague and providing a wide ambit to restrict the freedom of speech.   


B. Ultra vires : The order exceeds the ambit of Section 144 of CrPC

The impugned Order makes people who have been designated as “admins” on social media platforms personally responsible for dissemination of disinformation and also creates upon them a duty to report any person who is disseminating disinformation to the police. This exceeds the ambit of Section 144 of the CrPC under which the issuing authority can only pass a preventative order. The legal powers under it cannot be used to create a positive obligation upon a person to do a certain act.   


C.  Lack of proportionality : Order under S.144 CrPC must be based on the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive measure.

Any legitimate opinion or grievance, especially one which is critical of the government, could be qualified as one which is inciting mistrust towards the government under the order which is disproportionate as well as antithetical to the objective of the order itself. This would thus lead to the suppression of legitimate expression of opinion or grievance or exercise of any democratic rights which cannot be authorised under S.144.   


Additionally, we already have legal provisions which relate to the mischief that this order aims to cure. These legal provisions are [**Section 153A, IPC**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/345634/), [**Section 295A, IPC**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1803184/) and [**Section 505, IPC**](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1198526/).Thus, the order is not the least intrusive measure as required under [***Anuradha Bhasin v Union of India***](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/82461587/) which held that:  


*“...While exercising the power under Section 144, Cr.P.C. the Magistrate is duty bound to balance the rights and restrictions based on the principles of proportionality and thereafter apply the least intrusive measure. ”*  


**IFF’s recommendations**

Disinformation is a complex problem which must be addressed by a policy tool kit that promotes the values of free expression and also to exercise any censorship powers based on the legal standards that emerge that emerges from a human rights framework. Thus, IFF recommended that the Mumbai Police:

1. Review paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the order and amend the parts which are incompatible with the rights guaranteed by the Constitution of India.
2. Issue an advisory with a draft SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that draws from the “[**Joint Declaration on ‘Fake News’, Disinformation and Propaganda**](https://www.osce.org/fom/302796?download=true)” by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression dated March 3, 2017.  


**Section 144, CrPC is being misused**

As noted herein above the use of Section 144, CrPC must be based on the principle of proportionality and must be the least intrusive measure. However, misuse of Section 144, CrPC has become a troubling trend all over the [**country**](https://thewire.in/rights/ahmedabad-section-144-police). [**It is a provision which provides almost unbridled power to the executive**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/backgrounder-section-144-a-vestige-of-colonial-rule/article30352392.ece) and has also received criticism for being used to [**suppress dissent**](https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/opinion-section-144-is-colonial-tool-for-nationalist-oppression/345797). The [**Supreme Court**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/section-144-cannot-be-used-to-prevent-exercise-of-democratic-rights-says-sc/articleshow/73191967.cms) recently held that the provision cannot be used as a tool to prevent legitimate expression of opinion, grievance or exercise of democratic rights. [**However, ultra vires orders still continue to be passed under the section.** ](https://www.livelaw.in/columns/a-case-of-ultra-vires-orders-section-144-crpc-and-delhi-police-act-156619?infinitescroll=1)

### Tl;dr

As per [**a report**](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-csc-bhim-leak/) published by the website, “vpnMentor” a website that provided for on-boarding services for BHIM (a UPI payment app like Google Pay) contained a security vulnerability. This reportedly impacted millions of Indians for more than two years and exposed several, incredibly sensitive pieces of information including Aadhaar Cards and Caste certificates. While this immediately met with blanket denials from Government officials, we are urging for recommendations that will help improve our digital public infrastructure by encouraging cyber security researchers in India.

### A massive security vulnerability impacting millions of India

Two days back vpnMentor [**reported**](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/report-csc-bhim-leak/) a massive cyber security vulnerability impacting  sensitive financial and personal data impacting millions of Indians. Those impacted are from semi-urban and rural backgrounds leaving them particularly vulnerable and practically incapable to take effective steps to safeguard themselves.

The vulnerability impacted the website http://cscbhim.in/ which is operated by CSC e-Governance Services India Limited (CSC). CSC is a special purpose vehicle set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MEITY). The principal role of CSC has been to promote and on-board millions of Indians particularly farmers and semi-urban and rural businesses (Village Level Entrepreneurs or VLEs) towards Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) to ostensibly promote financial inclusion through electronic payments. 

The details of this vulnerability are truly shocking and reveal the following.

* **Nature of the security lapse:** The issue as explained is as follows, “*In this case, the data was stored on an unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. S3 buckets are a popular form of cloud storage across the world but require developers to set up the security protocols on their accounts. The exposed S3 bucket was labeled “csc-bhim”, and our team was quickly able to identify the developers behind the website “www.cscbhim.in” as the owners of the data.*” A further lapse indicated was, “*The S3 bucket also contained an Android application package (APK), a file format used by Android’s operating system for the distribution and installation of apps. AWS Key pairs are the equivalent of admin user/password in Amazon’s infrastructure, potentially giving the holder of the key access to all data, the ability to start and stop servers, access the S3 bucket’s controls, and more.*”
* **Details of the personal data:** The vulnerability impacted approximately 7.26 million records collected over the month of February 2019. Such records contained the details of scans of Aadhaar cards, scans of caste certificates, photos used as proof of residence, professional certificates and degrees, screenshots taken within financial and banking apps as proof of fund transfers along with Permanent Account Number (PAN) card details. To ensure authenticity, the researchers at vpnMentor have uploaded redacted screenshots of these records.
* **Impact of the security lapse:** Such a vulnerability would have impacted millions of ordinary Indians who were on boarded onto these services. In practical terms this has left them susceptible to identity theft, fraud and viral attacks. It may even lead to cases of extortion and phishing for sensitive information. Further levels of vulnerability would be high considering the target populations of CSC belong to semi-urban and rural backgrounds. Shockingly, as the researchers state, the exposed records included those of minors. These risks are escalated due to a lack of proper training, relative lack of user knowledge and further absence of meaningful consent during the onboarding process. As the researchers put it, “*The exposure of BHIM user data is akin to a hacker gaining access to the entire data infrastructure of a bank, along with millions of its users’ account information.***”**

**Can we go beyond bald denials and towards securing public, digital systems?**

Some issues emerge from this cyber security incident on which we make specific recommendations:

* **Admission and remedy by CSC:**  We were distressed by the official responses which rather than examining the nature of the claims in a meaningful manner, resorted to immediate denials. For instance as reported by MINT in it’s [**report dated June 1, 2020**](https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/records-of-bhim-users-allegedly-exposed-but-not-compromised-npci-denies-any-lapse-11591029987582.html), Shri Dinesh Tyagi, CEO of CSC has stated that, “*The claim is incorrect because we never captured Aadhaar data in the entire process*,"". Further, the National Payment Corporation of India, stated by a [**“Media Statement” dated June 1, 2020**](https://www.npci.org.in/sites/default/files/Media-statement-by-NPCI.pdf) on its website that, “*We would like to clarify that there has been no data compromise at BHIM App and request everyone to not fall prey to such speculations.*” While we do acknowledge that the security vulnerability does not impact BHIM by itself, it is plainly evident that the vulnerability impacted documents gathered through a referral partner (i.e. CSC) containing sensitive personal information. At the very least this requires a departmental inquiry. 
* **Timelines and breach notification by CERT-In:** As per the article CERT-In was first contacted on April 28, 2020 and date of action was May 22, 2020. This is almost a delay of close to two months in ensuring the proper configuration of a AWS S3 bucket of  a seemingly standard configuration. We urge that the reason for it may be examined internally in order to hasten timelines for action and remedy as each moment of vulnerability can be exploited by malicious actors to the vulnerability of lakhs of ordinary Indians. Ideally, on the discovery and closure of the vulnerability a public statement should also follow by CERT-In in addition to a specific notification to each effected person on how it may impact them and what steps they should take to mitigate harm.

### Promote, not only protect our security researchers!

In this context, the directions by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in its decision in Binoy Viswam v. Union of India \[2017 *SCC* OnLine *SC* 647 at Para 126(iii)\] serve as a reminder of the positive obligation to maintain data security when it stated that:

>*“It is also necessary to highlight that a large section of citizens feel concerned about possible data leak….It is important that the aforesaid apprehensions are assuaged by taking proper measures so that confidence is instilled among the public at large that there is no chance of unauthorised leakage of data whether it is done by tightening the operations of the contractors who are given the job of enrollment, they being private persons or by prescribing severe penalties to those who are found guilty of leaking the details….”*

Our broader recommendation is for a comprehensive and focussed push towards improving cyber security by encouraging Indian security researchers. We have anecdotally found that elite India's cybersecurity talent service foriegn clients that conduct their work domestically, or towards improving digital, public systems. 

A large part of this has to also do with the absence of legal clarity and an absence of a centralised system for bug identification and bounties. Promoting such a system would create the right incentives for growing homegrown talent. Several granular recommendations by us on this subject are contained in our submissions on the [**Personal Data Protection Bill**](https://internetfreedom.in/essential-features-of-a-rights-respecting-data-protection-law/) as well as the [**National Cyber Security Policy**](https://internetfreedom.in/security-researchers-need-legislative-protection-from-vexatious-lawsuits/).

1890,Advice needed to Self-register a Sole proprietor/OPC on MCA.gov.in using SPICe-32 form.,2,h0gzik,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/h0gzik/advice_needed_to_selfregister_a_sole/,False,8,Business/Finance,"Hi guys,

Firstly, a bit about my background- I am a freelance digital marketer, and a copywriter since past 2-2.5 years working with global clients. I don't have any company, or a website registered so far as there were never any legal/taxation implications I had to face. Or maybe if there is an obligation, I don't know. All my payments are via simple bank transfers.

Now, I am looking to venture into eCommerce, starting with dropshipping for which I need to register a company and get a GST number too. I might also use this company for a few other entrepreneurial ideas, and my own freelancing work as well if need be in the future.

I did research online and settled on either Sole proprietorship or an OPC, for now, to start dropshipping. I have doubts on the following -

1. Is OPC any better than SP for my work?


2. These days, one can register their own company and get a GST number online without having to rely on a professional. The only way I found out was on the [mca.gov.in](https://mca.gov.in) website through SPICe- 32 form. But I really have no clue if this is for company registration, and if it is, how to go about it step-by-step by myself. The FAQshonestly confuse me more than resolve. They have a video tutorial too which stops after 2 min of play, and the download takes forever.


3. Can we upgrade the company status to LLP, or PVT Ltd in future?


I know I can go to maybe vakilsearch or Indiafilings to get the work done, but a) I've heard mostly negative reviews only about them, and b) If I can do it by myself online, then why not! I just have to figure out the process.

Does any of you have any personal experience of registering a company by your own self, especially after online avenues such as SPICe - Form 32 have been introduced by the govt? If yes, then please share your insights. How exactly did you do it?

I wholeheartedly thank everyone in advance who take time out to explain me in detail.",1591842795.0,"IMHO, There is not really a big difference in OPC/SP .This ain't America where you can walk away from debt.

Anyway for SP GST registration,you can do it on your own on GST.gov.in

Yesterday evening as lockdown 4.0 was extended, we recorded a small but significant win. On May 2, based on your support, a letter was sent to the Ministry of Home Affairs by 45 civil society organisations and over 100 individuals clearly calling the Ministry to roll back an order requiring the mandatory use of Aarogya Setu ([**read more here**](https://internetfreedom.in/45-organizations-and-105-prominent-individuals-push-back-against-the-coercion-of-aarogya-setu/)). 

On Sunday evening, as an incremental first step the installation of Aarogya Setu has now been changed to a best effort basis ([**read more here**](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/aarogya-setu-mha-dilutes-mandatory-imposition-156921)). Endorsement and advocacy efforts by diverse organisations from trade unions to gender justice collectives signed on to this joint letter. They played a significant role in this shift, and the demands under it were widely covered in the press.

This change also comes after the Kerala High Court agreed to hear a plea drafted by IFF lawyers on behalf of Jackson Mathew, Managing Partner of Leetha Industries ([**read more here**](https://internetfreedom.in/kerala-hc-hears-challenges-against-mandatory-imposition-of-aarogya-setu/)). One of the main reliefs in this petition was for making Aarogya Setu purely voluntary. As per legal advice received from a skilled legal team led by Santhosh Mathewand Vrinda Bhandari, further steps will continue to be taken in this case.

But, work remains. Earlier, we noticed that within hours of this case getting activated, a “protocol” was also released that poorly addressed concerns of mass surveillance ([**read more here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-studied-the-protocol-and-no-this-doesnt-sufficiently-protect-your-privacy/)). Further the actual implementation may result in Aarogya Setu being “voluntary yet mandatory” in practice through other notifications and frameworks as being documented by a tracker created by the Internet Democracy Project ([**click here**](https://internetdemocracy.in/2020/05/aarogya-setu-tracker/)).

Today, let us remember that action matters. These small wins matter. They provide motivation and nourishment for the larger battles ahead. If you like IFF’s work on Aarogya Setu, I urge you to consider asking your friends, family and social networks to continue donating to us. Due to Covid our fundraising efforts have been impacted but we are confident that with your support we can weather this storm.

Then I check the FD and I can't see the option to break it and see the maturity date in 5 years and that's when I realized I put it in a Tax Saver FD. The ridiculous part is that it's a small checkbox which comes while creating the normal FD and I might've accidentally clicked it. It doesn't say anywhere that it's an unbreakable FD unless you click the small info button near the checkbox. I know I was stupid to be careless but I'm in need of that money.

Hello, 

I will be only taking a few mins of your valuable time.  

With all the global challenges we are facing today, many are pushed to the forefront while others lack attention. I believe that it is my responsibility to create awareness, encourage dialogue and promote change.  

Child marriage is an alarming large-scale human rights crisis across South Asia. South Asia accounts for almost half of child marriages that occur globally. As defined internationally, it is the marriage where one or both spouses are under the age of 18. Now you might be wondering why such an act may still be happening? There are many contributing factors involved. Several of the more prominent ones are poverty, gender equality, traditions and religious or social pressures. Research provides crucial evidence that child marriage doesn’t just impact the lives of 15 million girls every year but has a negative impact on the economic development of countries. You see, when a young girl is essentially deprived of her childhood, she is no longer able to be a reinvest in their own family or reducing their expected earnings. By ending child marriage, countries are able to not only boost their national earnings by 1% but also save trillions of dollars that could significantly impact the global economy.  

I have created a digital poster with the intention of inspiring thoughts and ideas that could lead change.

We also have to pay EMI's every month and develop properties regularly.


Coming to the point... We recently(very recent) leased one of our commercial properties to a retail company. We had to spend amounts close to 30-35 lacs to develop the property according to their needs. We agreed to a rent that is slightly less than the market value hoping that they are good clients and they'll be regular in giving rents.


During lockdown, as the property was in a green zone, they remained open throughout and I'm guessing they made profits much larger that before due to the shutting down of other local businesses.
Now recently they've asked us to reduce the rent they're paying (which is low already). We spent so much capital on renovating the property that we've got no money and huge loans.
